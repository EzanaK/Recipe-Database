             Salad Dressings

Ingredients:
     2/3           cup  low sodium chicken broth -- undiluted
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  2             ounces  pimiento -- drained and diced
  1         tablespoon  Italian seasoning
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Instructions:

Combine all ingredients in a jar; cover tightly and shake vigorously to
blend.  Shake well before serving.

I had some modifications [Valerie]:
I omitted the celery (Yuck!)
I omitted the pepperoncini peppers (Yuck!)
I doubled the artichoke hearts (Yum!!)
I used large mushrooms sliced, since there weren't small ones at the store
I had no Italian seasoning, so I used about a tablespoon of oregano and a
  tablespoon of basil, and it worked out fine.
I increased the olive oil by about a teaspoon.

You could use a light cheese tortellini or a different type of tortellini,
or even bow-tie pasta or something, to lessen the fat content.  This tasted
the best after it had marinated for about 2 days.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        peaches -- or any fruit
     1/2             C  apple juice -- to 3/4 C
  1                  T  lemon juice -- to 2 T

Instructions:


The mail with the smoothie recipe reminded me of a dirt-simple sorbet
recipe that is completely non-fat:

Cut enough ripe fruit (ripe peaches or nectarines are ideal)
to nearly fill your food processor or blender; cut into 3/4-inch chunks

Put 1/3 of the chunks into your freezer on a cookie sheet; spread just
enough so they won't touch each other

Put the other 2/3 in your refrigerator (in a covered bowl is fine)

When the 1/3 is frozen (wait for it!), dump both the frozen and
refrigerated chunks into your food processor or blender, along with
about 1/2-3/4 cup apple juice and 1-2 tablespoons lemon juice (you'll
need to experiment)

Puree' away! As soon as the fruit is pretty well pulverized, stop
puree'ing and slowly add confectioners sugar, blending each time,
until it is to your taste.

The sorbet is immediately ready to eat; perfect consistency. This
makes it a great after-dinner dessert when you have company over;
you can take it from freezer/fridge to serving in < 5 minutes.

Caution: If you use very very ripe peaches, for example, you may
not need much confectioner's sugar at all -- always taste before
you begin adding sugar.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1 1/8           cups  cake flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cake flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1              whole  egg white
     1/2           cup  skim milk
     1/2    tablespoon  vinegar
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
     3/4           cup  apple -- shredded
     1/4           cup  carrot -- shredded
     1/4           cup  unsweetened applesauce
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
                  dash  ginger
                  dash  cloves
                  dash  nutmeg

Instructions:

I tried (with a few minor modifications) the Apple Pie muffins Marg posted,
and they were wonderful!  They are the first muffins that actually have the
consistency of regular, non-lf muffins.  I did use the cake flour as Marg
suggested, but I had tried that in other muffin recipes, and still got that
very rubbery consistency that lf-sweet things tend to have. [nf]

Mix wet ingredients, and add dry.  Stir until everything is moistened (these
make a very wet batter).  Spray a muffin pan with Pam, and fill the muffin
cups 3/4 full.  Bake at 400 for 15-17 minutes, until a tootpick comes out
dry.

This was half of the original recipe, and made 9 average muffins.  If I had
a bigger pan, it probably would have made 6 nice-sized muffins.  Each has
less than 1 gram of fat per muffin.

Ingredients:
  2              large  sweet potatoes -- peeled, halved and
                        cut into 1/2 inch  thick slices
  2                     tart apples -- peeled, cored and
                        cut into thin slices
  2                     patties vegetarian breakfast sausage
     1/2          tsp.  cinnamon
  1              pinch  nutmeg

Instructions:

Boil the sweet potato slices until just barely tender.  Meanwhile, in a
non-stick skillet, Cook the veg sausage until well browned and crumbled.

Mix together the cooked sweet potatoes, apples, cooked sausage, corn,
cinnamon and nutmeg.  Transfer to a glass baking dish, cover and cook in a
350 oven until the apples are tender (about 45 minutes).  Serve hot.

Serves 4.  The veg. sausage I used had 4 grams of fat for two patties, so
this is still a very low fat recipe.

Instructions:

Take as large a microwave
safe pot as you have, fill it with apples, halved or quarted to make
more fit in the pot, then cook, covered, until soft. (I have a square
Corningware casserole and it takes 15-20 minutes I think--Haven't done
this since last year). Then run it thru a food mill or some sort of
sieve. I have a hand cranked strainer that looks something like the
old meat grinders, but the applesauce comes out the side, and the
pits, skin, etc comes out the end. It is very easy. Works well for
making tomato puree too (Which is why I bought it). This applesauce is
quite thick and very good. If I want it more like apple butter, I add
cinnamon and return to to the microwave for maybe half an hour, or
until desired color and thickness. And you don't have to stir.

Ingredients:
  5              Whole  apples -- up to 6
                        cinnamon
     3/4           Cup  maple syrup
     1/2           Cup  whole wheat flour
     1/2           Cup  oatmeal
     1/2           Cup  applesauce
     1/2           Cup  brown sugar

Instructions:

1.  Chop up the apples and place them in a 8x8 inch baking pan (use a bit
of PAM or an equivalent to lightly "grease" the pan.  But you can proabaly
get away without it).
2.  Pour the maple syrup over the apples and then sprinkle cinnamon over
it all (I like to use lots! :) ).
3.  In a bowl, mix together the flour and oatmeal.  Then add the applesauce
and brown sugar, and mix until the flour is just moistened and even a bit
dry in some parts.
4.  Spread (or sort of "spoon and pat") the flour/oatmeal/applesauce/brown
sugar mixture onto the apples.  It doesn't have to spread from edge to edge -
just spread it out best you can and don't worry about empty spots! :)
5.  Bake this in the oven at 375 degrees fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.

	When done, just "scoop" out of the pan, making sure to get both the
crunchy part (the croustarde) and the apples.  This is definitely not
something you can cut!  I usually just stand right over the oven and eat
it all straight from the pan!  :)

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        Filling:
  4               cups  apples -- cored and sliced
     1/4           cup  sugar -- or 1/2 cup
  1               dash  cinnamon
                        Topping:
  1                cup  oats
                        (quick or slow cooking types)
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  brown sugar
     1/2             T  baking powder

Instructions:

Place the filling ingredients in a saucepan and cook over medium to medium hi
heat until the apples are partially cooked, and they start to give off their
juice.

Mix the topping ingredients.
(at this point, some people might want to add a little liquid to get a more
crumbly consistency-I don't bother)

place half of topping mixture in a casserole dish, cover with apple mixture, and
place other half of oat mix on top.  Bake at 350 covered for about 15 minutes,
and remove cover and bake for another 10 minutes or so, until top lightly
browns.  Usually the apples bubble up and  cause the topping to stick together
so that the consistency is as good as if you used the butter that most recipes
call for-you won't miss it!

Recipe:      Apple Filled Acorn Squash
By:          Patti McCoy
Prep Time:   1:02
Categories:  Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Fruit
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2             medium  acorn squash
  1              pound  ground beef -- (90% lean)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2               cups  tart apples -- (2 large) pared and
                        chopped
     1/4           cup  raisins
  4        tablespoons  brown sugar -- packed
  2        tablespoons  light margarine -- melted
                        or liquid butter buds

Instructions:

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cut each of the squash in half and remove the
seeds and fibers.  Place the squash, cut sides down, in an ungreased baking
pan. Then add water to the depth of 1/4 inch and bake, uncovered, until the
squash is tender, about 30-40 minutes.  While the squash is baking, cook and
stir the meat in a large skillet until it is brown.  Drain off the excess
fat. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the salt,  cinnamon, apples
and raisins.  When the squash is cooked, turn them so that the cut side is up
and remove them to a platter. Drain off any remaining liquid in the pan and
dry.  Scoop out the pulp from the squash, making a shell that is 1/4 inch
thick all the way around.  Mash the pulp and mix in the meat mixture.  Return
to the shells, piling them full and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp of brown sugar on
each. Drizzle with the melted margarine (or liquid butter buds).  Bake,
uncovered until the apple is tender, about 20-30 minutes (I put it in the
microwave on HIGH for 5 minutes).  Serve hot.
NOTE:  You can substitute a combination of 1/2 lb 90% lean ground beef and
1/2 lb bulk turkey sausage for the 1 lb 90% lean ground beef.

Ingredients:
  2             pounds  tart apples -- peeled, cored and
                        sliced
     3/8           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  7 1/2         ounces  blackberries -- drained,
                        canned unsweetened
  5             ounces  lowfat yogurt -- (unsweetened)

Instructions:

Place apples, water and sugar in saucepan, cover and simmer gently until
soft.  Allow to cool.  Meanwhile, puree the blackberries in a blender or
food processor then sieve to remove pips.

Puree the apples, add to the blackberries, and fold in the yogurt.

Spoon into individual glass dishes and chill before serving.

I would probably add a little unflavoured gelatine, but it should be
very good whether or not.  Said to make 6 helpings, each 109 Kcals,

Ingredients:
  4             Ounces  Neufchatel Cheese -- softened
     3/4           Cup  Sugar -- divided
     1/2           Cup  Almonds -- ground
  1           Teaspoon  Vanilla Extract
  2                     Egg Whites
  5             Sheets  Phyllo Dough -- thawed
                        Butter Flavored Cooking Spray

                        halved lengthwise
  2        Tablespoons  Honey -- warmed

Instructions:

Beat the cheese at medium speed of a mixer until smooth.  Add 1.2 cup sugar, ground almonds, vanilla extract, and egg whites, and beat  until well blended.  Set Aside.

Working with 1 phyllo sheet at a time, coat each sheet with cooking spray, and fold in half crosswise, forming a 13x8 1/2- inch rectangle.  Gently press 1 folded sheet of phyllo into a 10-inch tart pan, allowing ends to extend over edges of pan; recoat phyllo with cooking spray.  Place another folded sheet of phyllo across the first sheet in a crisscross design; recoat phyllo with cooking spray.  Repeat procedure with remaining sheets.  Decoratively crimp edges of phyllo crust, and spread cheese mixture evenly into crust.

Cut each apple half crosswise into thin slices, leaving slices stacked together to keep shape of apple half.  Place 6 apple halves around edge of tart and 1 in the center of cheese mixture;  sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar.  Bake at 350 ° for 50 minutes or  until mixture is puffed and golden and apples are tender.  Brush with honey.

  1         tablespoon  celery -- finely chopped

  1         tablespoon  raisins
  1         tablespoon  Miniature marshmallows

Instructions:


My favorite apple salad uses a cream cheese based
dressing (and I use the fat free cream cheese of
course).

Dressing:
About a tablespoon of ff cream cheese mixed with enough
pineapple juice to make it thin enough to pour

Mix everything together and let it sit for about half an
hour (in the frig) for the flavors to blend.

This is my very favorite version of Waldorf Salad -- and
all of the people at my church love to see it when we
have a pot luck dinner.  I never have to worry about
leftovers even when I triple or quadruple the recipe.
Hope you like it too.

Recipe:      Apple-rhubarb Sauce

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  3              large  Rhubarb -- about 1 lb
  3              large  Golden Delicious Apples -- or other sweet apple
                        -- about 1 1/2 lb
     1/2        basket  strawberries
  14              cups  Water -- just a little really

Instructions:

- peel and chop the rhubarb
- wash, core, and chop the apples.  Don't remove the peel unless you
really don't like it...
- cut stems off strawberries and chop in quarters
- toss all of it into pot, add enough water to cover bottom of pot
- cook on medium for 5-10 minutes then turn down and simmer until the
sauce reaches desired consistency - another 15-30 minutes. Stir
occasionally with a long-handled spoon to help break things up.

enjoy warm or cold.

NOTE:  The proportions here produce a very tart sauce.  Add more apples or
a little sweetener (honey would be good) if you prefer less tart.

NOTE:  If you don't like the peels in the sauce, try cooking it that way
anyway and then pureeing the whole thing in a food processsor.  Or put it
all through a food mill, then scoop out the peels (which won't make it
through and won't grind real well and puree just the peels in a f.p.)

Categories:  Cakes & Frostings
             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Sauces & Gravies
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  white flour
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour -- pastry flour
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsweetened applesauce
     1/4           cup  oil
  2                     egg whites
  2                     eggs
  3               cups  carrots -- coarsely grated
                        (about 3/4 lb.)

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the flours, sugar, baking soda,
cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.

In a medium bowl, combine the applesauce, oil, eggs, and add
them to the flour mixture, stirring until the ingredients are
well blended. Add the carrots and mix again to combine. Pour the
batter into a greased 9" bundt or tube pan.

Bake for about 1 hour 10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted
in the thickest part of the cake comes out clean. [In my convection
oven, it took about 65 minutes.] Set the cake pan on a wire rack
to cool for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to
loosen [I used a non-stick pan so this wasn't necessary] and turn
the cake onto the rack to cool completely.

I don't have the nutritional analysis, but it comes in around 25% CFF
and 190 calories per serving (12 servings). It's also very high in
vitamin A (115% of the RDA, I believe).

(makes 12-16 servings)

                        or "Just Whites" -- work well
                        grated zest of 1/2 lemon
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract -- (1.25 ml)
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds -- (60 ml)  toasted

Instructions:

Soak apricots in water and Amaretto for 30 minutes. Place apricots and any
liquid in a food processor or blender. Process to a thick puree. Transfer to a
small saucepan and cook over ow heat, uncovered, to form a thick puree; stir
frequently. Chill.

Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold in puree, lemon zest, and vanilla. Spoon1/2
cup (118 ml) of apricot mousse into serving dishes or tuille. Sprinkle with
toasted almonds. Serve at once.

Makes 8 servings.

The mousse is supposed to go into lemon tuiles ( a tulip shaped molded cookie).
That would be great for a dessert for special occaisions but I liked the mousse
alone.

Recipe:      Apricot Oat Cakes

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  3               cups  rolled oats -- up to 3 1/2 cups
  2               cups  flour
     1/4           tsp  baking powder
     1/3           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
     1/2           cup  fructose -- crystalline
                        or granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           tsp  vanilla
  1                     egg white -- or equivalent
     1/2           cup  dried fruit -- (12 dried apricots)

Instructions:

Thoroughly grind rolled oats in food processor or blender.  Mix
with flour and baking powder.

Chop dried fruit into small pieces.  You could use apricots, raisins,
dates, dried apples, dried cranberries, or anything else you like.

In a separate bowl, "cream" together yogurt, fructose, honey,
and vanilla.  In yet another bowl, lightly beat egg white until
it gets bubbly but not stiff.  Fold egg white into the wet
ingredients.  Add dried fruit.

Combine wet and dry ingredients.  The dough gets pretty stiff and
is hard to mix.  You may even have to dive in there with your hands
and squish it together!  Form into 12 patties (these are smaller than
the store-bought ones -- you could probably make them bigger if you
want).

Bake at 325 degrees F for 15 minutes on a non-stick cookie sheet.  Cool
completely and store in refrigerator.  These keep well and may be
frozen.


These oat cakes are the result of my attempts to recreate the dense,
heavy oat cakes available in some coffee houses and health food
stores in northern California.  They're shaped like hockey pucks,
and they come in apricot/raisin or cinnamon apple.

Ingredients:
  5                  C  Water -- lukewarm
  2 1/4             Oz  Active Dry Yeast -- pkg
  1                Tsp  Sugar
  5                 Lb  Flour -- + flour for dusting
  2                Tsp  Salt
     1/4            Lb  Melted Butter -- or crisco
  2                     Eggs -- optional
  1               Tbsp  Olive Oil

Instructions:

See the Lavash variation at the end of the recipe.

1. Pour 1/4 cup of the water into a small bowl, add the yeast and sugar, stir to dissolve, then cover and set aside to proof.
2. Add flour into a large mixing bowl, sprinkle it over the salt, make a well in the center and pour in the yeast, remaining water, butter and eggs if used, scraping and incorporating the flour that sticks to the sides of the bowl.
3.knead for 10 min. until dough is smooth and elastic and does not stick to the hands.  Add more warm water if dough feels stiff.  Pour half the olive oil into one palm and shape dough into a ball, turning to coat all sides.
4. Xfer the dough to a clean bowl.  Add remaining oil and turn dough again.  Cover w/ plastic sheet, wrap well and set aside in a warm draft free place until doubled in bulk.
5. Punch dough down, divide into 20 to 25 balls.  Keep well wrapped till ready to roll out.
6. Pick up the first ball, flatten it with the hands or a rolling pin into a circle about six inches in dia.  Use the reserved flour for rolling the circles of dough.  Sprinkle both sides with flour and continue with remaining balls, stacking the circles in six or eight piles.
7. Remove oven shelving, heat oven to 500 deg.  Broiler pan should be at closest level to flame.  Have on hand a standard size rolling pin, a long thin dowel a large spatula and a fork.
8. Sprinkle flour on counter surface, take the first circle of dough and with rolling pin roll it to the size of a large pie crust or about 15" in dia.
9. Prick dough with fork all over.  Drape over dowel and place it on the oven floor.  This will bake in about 90 seconds.  Use long spatula to pick up the bread and place it under the broiler for another 90 secs.  Lower oven heat to 450 if bread is baking faster than 3 min.
10. Keep breads in a cool place.  Will keep for months and can be eaten dry or sprinkled with water.

Yield:  20-25 15" in dia.

To make Armenian Lavash, bake the last few breads with the oven door open.  Bake until it is a light brown on the bottom, turn over and bake until other side is browned.  Don't close door while baking.  The result is a soft bread which is delicious bread when spread with butter or eaten with cheese and olives.

Instructions:


Noodles are a staple in countries	throughout Asia--China, Japan, Thailand,	Vietnam, Korea-- and many types can now be	found in our Oriental-food	stores and more and more, in supermarkets.
Use them as they're used in	their countries of origin: in soups and	stir fries, or with meats or fish.

Thai flat rice noodles, are called	jantaboon noodles in Thailand, are also	native to China and Vietnam.

Japanese chuka soba noodles, a new	lower-fat version of the familiar ramen	noodle, made from wheat. Its bright golden
color comes from food coloring,	not egg yolk.

Chinese bean thread noodles, also known as	cellophane, crystal, or glass noodles, found all across Asia, are made	from mung bean starch.

Soba noodles are buckwheat noodles,	popular in northern Japan, where	they're traditionally eaten on New Year's
Day.

Japanese udon noodles, made with rice	flour, are thicker and chewier than	the others .

                        lemon-pepper
                        diet margarine

Instructions:

Tender spears can be steamed
until tender-crisp and then marinated in lemon juice, olive oil and a hint of
garlic. Serve cold on a lettuce lined platter garnished with lemon wedges.Or
try this with fresh or frozen asparagus:  Cook until tender-crisp, drain and
cool.  Cut crusts from a firm sliced white bread (such as Pepperidge Farms),
flatten slices with a rolling pin and spread with lite (NOT Fat-free) cream
cheese which has been well seasoned with lemon-pepper.  Roll asparagus spears
in bread slices (trimming vegetable ends to fit if necessary), secure with
toothpicks.  Chill thoroughly, then brush with reduced fat margarine and
bake, seam side down, at 350F for approx. 20 minutes or until hot and crispy.

Ingredients:
  2             pounds  asparagus
  1 1/3           cups  ricotta cheese -- light
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper -- freshly ground
  8             ounces  pasta -- penne

Instructions:

1.  Bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot for cooking
the pasta.

2.  Snap off the tough ends from the asparagus spears.  Cut the spears in
half lengthwise (thicker spears should be quartered), then slice them on
the bias into 1-inch pieces.  Steam the asparagus until crisp-tender,
about 2 minutes.  Set the cooked asparagus aside.

3.  Combine the two cheeses with the basil, salt, and pepper in a medium
bowl.  Set the mxiture aside.

4.  While preparing the sauce, cook the pasta.  Just before it is done,
carefully remove 1/3 cup of the cooking liquid and stir it into the cheese
mixture.  The cheese sauce should be smooth and creamy.

5.  Drain the pasta, making sure that some water still clings to the
noodles.  Toss the hot pasta with the ricotta mixture and asparagus.  Mix
well to coat the pasta with the sauce.  Transfer portions to warm pasta
bowls and serve immediately.

  2             Medium  Oranges

Instructions:

   Preparation and cooking time: 30 minutes + 1 hour chilling Calories per
   serving: 295

   Freezing not recommended

   1. Cook the pasta in plenty of lightly salted boiling water for 8 -1 0
  minutes or until al dente. Rinse well with cold water and drain thoroughly.
   Place in a salad bowl. 2. Peel the oranges, carefully removing all the
   pith. Segment the oranges over a bowl to catch the juices and add the
   segments to the pasta. 3. Mix the oil and wine vinegar with the reserved
   orange juice and season with salt and pepper. Carefully spoon the dressing
   into the pasta, stirring gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour
   to allow the flavours to develop. 4. just before serving, peel, quarter and
   thickly slice the avocado and gently fold it into the pasta. Sprinkle with
   the toasted pine kernels and serve immediately.

   Cook's note: Sprinkle the sliced avocado with lemon juice to prevent it
   turning brown.

   Selections per serving: 1-1/2 Carbohydrate; 2 Fat; 1/2 Fruit; 50 Optional
   Calories

   Variations: Replace the pine kernels with 2 tablespoons of bacon bits. This
   will reduce the Optional Calories to 45 per serving and make it unsuitable
   for vegetarians. Try substituting the olive oil with hazelnut or walnut oil
   to add a subtle nutty flavour to the dressing.

Recipe:      Backpacking Simple Food Ideas

Categories:  Camping, Backpack, Trail Food

             Vegan
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        ****

Instructions:

Here are very, very simple ideas for dehydrated and light-weight foods.

1) Any packaged dinner mix from the grocery and packed in ziploc baggies

   ie, Macaroni & Cheese, Rice-a-Roni, Broccoli and Cheese, etc
   There are tons of these things available today. If they call for milk, then
   the boys can carry powdered milk in baggies. Margarine will travel well, and
   since they will be working hard, the extra fat might be desireable.

2) Instant oatmeal and instant grits and bagels are great for breakfast. Again,
   powdered milk can be used with these. Get some of the new Fantastic
Foods hot
   cereal mixes--they are warm and filling.

3) Dehydrated vegetables and full meals can be found in camping stores. Add
   dried peas to a box of mac & cheese, for instance

4) Try Ramen noodle soups, or any of those "soup in a cup"s (that can be
   packaged in baggies so they take up less room).

5) Dehydrated bean flakes that mix up almost instantly with water are available
   in HFS. Mix these with some cooked minute rice and put in a tortilla. Yum!
   Flavor them with onion, garlic, cumin powders.

6) Cheese backpacks well. Again, the fat may not be so bad if they are hiking
   all day. And if it's cold, then the fat is almost necessary to help them
   stay warm. (You need a lot more calories when it's cold.) Add a hunk to any
   soup, pasta, rice, or dehydrated veggies you're cooking.

7) Pasta, pasta, pasta. Top it with sauces made from the dry package mixes. A
   lot of these are tasty. High in sodium and preservatives sometimes, but for
   a couple of meals they won't hurt you.

8) Instant mashed potatoes that can be mixed with the powdered milk or water
   only. Make up an instant gravy to go top. (I *really* like the Hain's brown
   gravy mix and it's fatfree and all natural.)

9) Dried fruit can be cooked in some water and put on top of a piece of angel
   food cake for dessert. (Hey, the cake might get crushed a little, but it
is
   lightweight!) Add some cinnamon and Tang (in lieu of orange juice)
   and you approximate a Cooking Light recipe.

10) The dry veggie burger mixes would make a great meal. Most of them make up
    with water only and many are quite tasty.

11) Bulgar and couscous cook up in only a few minutes with boiling water.

12) There are lots of dried meats and fish available, but I've never used them

As you can see, when we camp, I like to cook things that require water
only. No fancy cooking and then tough clean up for me! I find that when I'm
"on the trail", ALL foods taste wonderful because I'm always so hungry. I
eat things when hiking that I'd never, ever eat at home.

Instructions:

We mix a lb. of tofu with a tablespoon each of chile powder and cumin, and a
teaspoon of salt.  Mash (or process) it all up and cook it
over an extremely low light for about 3 hours, stirring
occasionally, ending up with it so dry there's no sensible
moisture and it seems to keep indefinitely without
refrigeration.  We grind it up and have what we think is a
good meat substitute for pasta sauces, tacos/burritos,
potato topping, or even mixing in slaws/salads.

     1/8           tsp  fat-free parmesan cheese
     1/8           tsp  chili powder

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 400 or toaster oven works fine.  With a sharp knife, slice
bagel into very thin slices so that you can almost see through them (you'll
get about 10 slices). Place slices on a baking sheet.  Lightly spray with
cooking spray.  Quickly sprinkle in a small amount of seasoning (a little
goes a long way) or leave plain. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes until lightly
browned-be careful; they burn easily. Break each slice into 4 chips.

Bagel magic

The bagel-making process defies logic:
To achieve the crusty outside that encloses
the chewy inside, you must first simmer the
uncooked bagels in water before baking them.
If you're making bagels for the first time,
you may well suspect you'll end up with
waterlogged blobs of dough.  Fear not;
the process has stood the test of time, and
your results will be similar to (or better than)
bagels found at your local bakery.

Bagels, you may be surprised to learn, are
actually easy to create; the following recipe
yields authentic results that are unbelievably
fresh.  Make sure you use real gluten flour,
available at natural food stores and specialty
food stores, unless your flour contains a added
gluten.  Gluten is what makes the dough elastic,
and the finished bagel chewy.


In a small bowl, stir together 1/2 cup warn water,
1:1/2 teaspoons sugar and yeast.  Let stand 10 minutes
or until foamy.  (If mixture does not foam, yeast is not
fresh enough or water was too hot or too cold, and dough
will not rise properly.)

In a large bowl, combine gluten flour, 2 cups all-purpose
flour, salt and remaining 1:1/2 cups warm water.  Add yeast
mixtures and beat with electric mixer on low speed or by
hand for at least 5 minutes. Add 2 more cups flour; mix
until dough turns into a ball.

Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead by hand
until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if necessary,
about 5 minutes.  Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and place
in a warm, draft-free location.  Let dough rise until doubled
in size, about 1 hour.

Turn dough onto floured surface and knead by hand until
smooth and elastic, adding more flour if necessary, about 5
minutes.  Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl.  Cover
with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and place in a warm,
draft-free location.  Let dough rise until doubled in size,
about 1 hour.

Turn dough onto floured surface again and punch down.  Knead
until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes.  Divided dough into
12 pieces, and shape each piece into a circle. With your thumb,
press a hole in the middle.  Work bagel around thumb to create
the desired size hole.

After each bagel is formed, place on a lightly floured surface and
cover with a dry towel.  When all bagels are formed, cover dry towel
with a damp towel and let bagels rest until they are 1:1/2 times their
original size (not doubled in bulk), about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425 degree.  Prepare a water bath by
bringing 1 gallon water and 5 tablespoons sugar to a boil in a large
pot.  Reduce heat until water is just simmering.

When bagels have risen, transfer them to the simmering bath, no more
than 3 at a time, with a slotted spoon.  Bagels will sink, then rise to
surface.  (If they don't sink, they rose too much.  There's no harm
done; they will just be oversized and less chewy.)  Simmer bagels for 1
minute, flip and simmer 1 minute more.  Remove to a large baking sheet
covered with parchment paper or to a lightly greased air-cushioned
baking sheet.  (Do not use a regular greased baking sheet; bagels will
burn and stick.)

Brush bagels with egg white, if desired, for a high-gloss shine.
Sprinkle with desired toppings.  If not using egg white, dip bagels in
desired toppings and place facedown on baking sheet.  Bake in center of
oven for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and turn over.  Bagel should be
set but not browned.  Bake 10 minutes more or until bagels are toasty
brown (some ovens may require as much as 30 minutes of baking).

Cool bagels and store in a plastic bag in refrigerator to keep fresh
for several days.  Freeze any bagels you won't be consuming within a
few days' time.  Makes 12 bagels.

Recipe:      Bagels #2

Categories:  Breads
             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegan
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2          Teaspoons  yeast
  2               Cups  warm water
  1         Tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  salt
  5               Cups  flour
                        see directions for variations

Instructions:

Mix together and knead for 8 minutes by hand or 4 minutes in bread
mixer.  Let raise for 20 minutes.  Divide into 16 equal pieces.  Form
into round bagel shape.  Use thumb to punch hole in middle.  Let
raise for 20 minutes.

When you have about 8-10 minutes left of the raising time, start a
pan of water boiling.  I use a deep frying pan.  I also start
preheating my oven at about this same time.  It takes a while to get
it up to 500 degrees.

Boil bagels for 45 seconds on one side, turn over and boil on the
other side for 30 seconds.  Bake at 525 for 10 minutes.  (My oven
doesn't go to 525 so I bake mine at 500 for 12 minutes)

Variations:

CINNAMON RAISON:  Add 3 to 4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup raisins

ONION:  Add 1 Tblsp. dried onion and 1 tsp onion powder

FRUIT:  Add about 2 cups thawed and drained frozen berries.  You will
also need to add extra flour to get a consistency that you can work
with.  Divide your dough into about 20 equal pieces.  I have used
Strawberries, Raspberries and blackberries.

milk, vanilla, sugar, nutmeg, and salt.  Stir in the berries.

Set a small sifter in a dish and pour the confectioner's sugar into it.  Set
this and the lemon half (plus a reamer if you have one) near the stove.

Pour the batter into the preheated pan and return it to the oven to bake for
15 - 20 min, until the edges are puffed up high and are golden brown.
Remove the pan from the oven.  Squeeze the juice of the halved lemon over
the whole surface of the pancake, and sift on the confectioner's sugar.
Serve hot, directly from the baking pan, cut into wedges.  Spoon a little of
the pan sauce over each slice.

Yield:  One 10" pancake; 4 servings.

Advance Preparation:
Baking pan must be preheated in the oven for at least 15 min before adding
the batter.  The pancake must be served as soon as it is baked.

Temperature and Time:
425 deg F for 20 min to preheat pan, plus 15 min to bake pancake.

Although the recipes contains blueberries, you can make it with other
berries or sliced fruit.  Or you can make it plain without any berries, just
lemon juice and sugar on top.  Or as a dessert you could prepare the pancake
plain and serve it with a fruit compote and vanilla nonfat/lowfat/regular
yogurt.

Ingredients:
  1                cup  Lentils -- washed
  1                cup  Water
  1                cup  Onion -- chopped
  1              Clove  Garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  Oregano
  1           teaspoon  Thyme
  1           teaspoon  Basil
  1         tablespoon  Chopped Parsley
                        Add:
     1/2                Carrot -- chopped
     1/2                Celery Stalk -- chopped
  1                Can  Tomatoes -- w/ juice, peeled
                        and chopped

Instructions:

I have found that most FF cheeses will melt and become bubbly if you
mist them (or brush lightly, whatever method) with olive oil.  I
frequently make broiled tomatoes by slicing them in half, sprinkling
with italian flavored bread crumbs, and placing a slice of Weight
Watchers or Healthy Choice Fat Free Sharp Cheddar on top.  Mist with
oil, and broil for 5ish minutes.  Wonderful results and a very nice
dinner when you add a mixed greens salad with balsamic vinegar.

I have found I get the same results with my baked lentils.  This recipe
is from memory, but I'm pretty close:

Mix the above together and place in a covered casserole dish.  Bake
at 375 for 30 minutes.  Then add carrot, celery and tomatoes.
Bake another 40 minutes or until lentils are done and have absorbed most
of the liquid.  Top with 1 to 1-1/2 cups of shredded cheese (I use Healthy
choice fat free mozzerella misted with olive oil) and sprinkle with
chpped parsley.  Return to warm oven until cheese melts.


This makes quite a few servings.  I've never measured out how much fat
and calories are in this.  It's what I commonly make when going to a
potluck anymore because it's lowfat, healthy, and different from the
standard potato or pasta salad.  If you add extra herbs, it almost comes
out tasting like pizza.  Oh, if you use regular mozzerella, you
don't need to mist with the oil, and it actually comes out 'okay' if you
dont mist the FF stuff either.

and flour browned to a certain point.    A baked roux can substitute
nicely in some recipes.  To bake a roux, preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Put some (about 1/3 c.) of flour pie pan or cake pan which has been
sprayed with PAM.    Bake at 400 degrees stirring frequently until roux
is caramel colored and just begins to have a burnt smell.   Don't bake
it any longer!    Store roux in refrigerator .  When recipe calls for
roux add an equal measure of water to whatever amount of flour is called
for in the recipe.

Instructions:

Servings:  6

 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat a large skillet. Toast the cut tortillas on the dry skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until they are crisp. Transfer to a plate to cool. Heat the oil in the same skillet. Add the onions and saute over moderate heat until transplucent.
Add the garlic and pepper and saute until the onion turns golden and the peppers soften. Add the tomatoes and saute for another 2 to 3 minutes, just until they soften a bit. Combine the beaten eggs with the milk in a mixing bowl. Stir in the mixture from the skillet, the tortilla bits, and all the remaining ingredients. Oil two 9-inch pie tins and divide the mixture among them. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until set and golden on top. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving, then cut into wedges to serve.

Ingredients:
                        ****

Instructions:

A fun and easy way to use tortillas is to make something I call "Baked Tacos,"
which is more like a casserole than tacos.  I take a casserole dish and
spray it
with Pam, then take fat-free tortillas, cut them into wedges, approximately the
size of tortilla chips, then I layer the tortillas with a number of
ingredients (depends
on what I have on hand), usually including, beans, salsa, fresh peppers, onions,
shredded chicken or turkey, fatfree cheese, sliced jalepenos (if you like
HOT food),
topping it off with tortilla wedges, more salsa, and fatfree cheese.  Bake
this until
bubbly-hot and it is a wonderful dish.  Can be served with a dollop of fat-free
sour cream on top, if you wish.  Tastes great cold, too, if you have left-overs.

Ingredients:
  3             medium  red onions
                        salt and pepper
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar

Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 375 F. Remove the outermost layer of onion skin,
spray the onions with cooking spray, and sprinkle them with salt and
pepper. Place the onions close together in a baking dish and roast,
uncovered, about 1 1/2 hours, until tender when pricked with a fork. (
The onions will release their juices while roasting and should be soft
but not mushy.)

Remove the onions from the pan and set aside. Add the water to the
baking dish and stir to loosen and collect the pan juices; transfer to
a small saucepan. Add the vinegar and cook over medium heat for 2 to 3
minutes, reducing the mixture to about 1/4 cup syrup.

Cut the onions in half lengthwise and brush the cut surface generously
with the syrup, allowing it to sink down into the layers. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper to taste and serve.

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
                        (or 1 1/2 t. at highaltitude)*
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
                        (or 1/4 t. at high altitude)*
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  2                     egg whites -- or substitute
  1 1/2           cups  mashed bananas
  1 1/2           cups  All-Bran(r) Cereal -- (Kellogg's)
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  applesauce
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4           cup  honey -- (1/4 to 1/2)

Instructions:

Here's my recipe adapted from a recipe on the Nabisco 100% Bran cereal box.
This makes a very dense and heavy muffin just the way I like it.  If you
prefer a lighter muffin than just add all-purpose flour for some or part of
the whole wheat flour.

Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in large
bowl.  Beat egg in medium bowl, stir in bananas, cereal, water, applesauce,
vanilla, and honey.  Add to flour mixture.  Stir JUST UNTIL MOISTENED!
(Batter will be lumpy.)  Fill muffin tin.  Makes 12 average size muffins.
Bake at 400 F. for 18-22 min.

A good variation that I have tried is using pureed peaches instead of
bananas.  You might have to cut back on the water a little for that
depending on how juicy your peaches are.  When I add peaches I also like to
add a little extra nutmeg.  Maybe I should try this with rhubarb.  I know I
would have to increase the honey quite a bit!

  2                tsp  ground cinnamon
  1                tsp  ground cardamom

Instructions:

(makes 3 loaves)


My SAD husband said to tell my virtual friends that it was
"very, very good". [Stephanie]

1. Preheat oven to 325F.
2. Line the bottoms and a bit up the sides of 3 loaf tins
(8x41/2?) with waxed paper. Or use non-stick tins. (Either
works)
3. In one bowl, combine the ingredients from bananas to vanilla.
4. In another bowl, combine the remaining (dry) ingredients.
5. Add the wet ingredients to the dry - do not overmix! The
batter will be fairly thick and lumpy. (If it's too runny, it takes too
long to cook and loses texture.)
6. Split the batter between the loaf tins.
7. Bake for approximately 40 minutes. Probably should start
checking at 30 minutes. A toothpick should come out clean
when stuck into the loaf.

For muffins (makes 24 large): Add 1 cup raisins (optional)
and bake for 26 minutes in a 325F oven.

  1                Cup  mashed bananas -- (about 3 small)
     1/4           Cup  sugar cube -- or3 pkts sweet-n-low
     1/2           Cup  plain nonfat yogurt
     1/4           Cup  Butter buds(r) -- liquid
  1                Tsp  vanilla
  1                     egg
  1                     egg white
  2               Cups  all-purpose flour
  1                Tsp  baking powder
     1/2           Tsp  baking soda
     1/4           Tsp  salt

Instructions:

  Combine first 7 ingredients in a large bowl: beat at medium speed of an
electric mixer until well blended.  Combine flour and next 3
ingredients.  Add flour mixture to banana mixture, stir just until
moistened.  Spoon batter into an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 3-inch loaf pan coated
with baking spray with flour.  Bake at 350 for 1 hour and 5 minutes or
until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 10 minutes
in pan on a wire rack; remove form pan, and cool completely on a wire rack.


  I started with a recipe from cooking light, and made a few
substitutions.  It is the best recipe that I have found, and it hasn't
collapsed on me yet.
  Original recipe had 150 calories, 30% from fat, but I omited 1/4 cup
margarine, 1/4 cup pecans, and reduced sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup.  Have
no idea what the percentage of fat or calories are now.
  This recipe could also be made lower in fat if you substituted the eggs
with egg-beaters.

     1/2           Cup  nuts -- optional

Instructions:

Sift together dry ingredients.  In a separate bowl, mix together wet
ingredients, including bananas.  Fold wet mixture into flour mixture until
just moistened.  Pour into 1 large loaf pan or two small ones.  Bake at
325 until toothpick comes out clean.  This may take an hour or more, but
the low temperature will ensure the middle gets baked without burning
the outside.  The texture of this bread is a bit rubbery, but the flavor
is great.  I personally add 1 or 2 T oil in order to soften the texture,
but if you want VLF, then leave it out.  Maybe egg substitute would help
with the fat also, I've never tried it.  Anyway, since this bread tends
to be a little rubbery and very moist, I make toast out of it and it is
very good that way.

extract, and stir to mix well.

Coat a 9 x 13" pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Spread the batter evenly in
the pan.  Bake at 350 deg F for about 35 min., or just until a wooden
toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.  Cool the cake
to room temp.

To make the glaze, combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl.  If using
a microwa e oven, microwave the glaze, uncovered, at high power for 35
seconds, or until runny.  If using a conventional stove top, transfer the
glaze to a small saucepan and place over medium heat for 30 seconds,
stirring constantly.  Drizzle the glaze over the cake, and let harden before
cutting into squares and serving.

This is quick and really excellent tasting.

Instructions:

(makes 1 5x4 inch loaf, 8 servings)

This recipe is from the Zojirushi Home Bakery Recipe Book. I have
modified it to reduce the fat. I don't know how many people have a
bread machine that does quick breads, but I thought I'd offer it
just the same. I've provided the original recipe in paratheses.
If you are interested in reducing the fat in quick breads, you could make
similar modifications. [Sharon]

[There was 2/3 cup sugar which I cut out entirely. The extra banana and
 the apple sauce make it sweet enough. Actually, this was a mistake. I
 forgot the sugar! But it came out ok anyway.]

Into baking pan measure flours, baking powder, soda, salt. Add oil,
eggs, apple sauce, yogurt and vanilla. Insert pan securely into unit;
close lid. Select cake setting and press start.

When beep sounds, add banana and nuts. Press start again.

The complete light will flash when bread is done.

Using hotpads, remove pan from unit; pull out kneading rod. Turn
bread out onto cooling rack. Cool.

Ingredients:
  3 1/2              c  white flour
  2                tsp  baking soda
  1                tsp  baking powder
     1/4           tsp  salt -- (1/4 to 1/2)
     3/4             c  oatmeal
     1/2             c  wheat germ
     1/2             c  oat bran
     1/2             c  sunflower seeds -- (as you wish)
     1/2           cup  pecans -- crushed(as you wish)
  3                     Egg Beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
  3                     apples -- finely chopped
                        unpeeled (Jonathon)
  1                can  crushed pineapple -- (8 oz) incl. juice
  8                     bananas -- mashed
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1                  c  sugar
  1                  c  brown sugar
  1               dash  vanilla
  2                tsp  cinnamon
                        I didn't add it but ginger and cloves
                        would also be good

Instructions:

I put all this together and baked at 350 until done - I don't
remember how long it was.  Keep in mind that when I bake I
go by feel so if this is too thick - add some more buttermilk -
if too thin - then add some more wheat germ and oat bran and flour.
I used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites as I like a bit of a firmer
cake.  I frosted it with the following -

1 ctn ff cream cheese
1 ctn lowfat ricotta
powder sugar (again, by feel)
1 box instant pudding - coconut (I wanted vanilla but didn't have it)
nf milk to thin out
vanilla (1 tsp or so)

add together and whip with whisk til pudding gets thick.  I probably
used 1 cup powdered sugar and a tablespoon of nf milk.
Use your judgement.  I like thick frosting.  Frost when cake is
cool .  My husband tells me this is one of my better efforts.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1              large  banana -- per person
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  calvados -- grand marnier or
                        cointreau
  5                 oz  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  molasses -- sugar
  1                     egg
  4                 oz  flour
  10            ounces  beer -- lager

Instructions:

(serves 3-4)

Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way (I
used a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan).  Fold each
pancake in half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle
(if you're as bad at cooking pancakes as I am, they'll come out in bits
anyway - if so, pretend it didn't happen!), and place them in a large
flan dish.

Peel bananas, cut in half long-ways and in half again cross-ways, and
place face-down on top of the pancakes.  Put the remaining ingredients
into a frying pan or small saucepan, and boil for 3-4 minutes, until
just beginning to be syrupy.  Pour over bananas and pancakes, and
bake in a moderate oven (Mark 4 - 350 F) for 20-30 minutes.

I served this with fromage frais (cream substitute) and a chocolate
sauce (see recipe).

     3/4         pound  eggplant
     1/2         pound  potatoes
     1/3           cup  onion -- sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seed
     1/2      teaspoon  coriander seed -- roasted and crushed
  1           teaspoon  ginger root -- grated
  4             cloves  garlic -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
  1         tablespoon  nonfat yogurt

     1/3           cup  tomato -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped

Instructions:

Wash  the eggplant. Cut it into quarters lengthwise, then, holding the pieces
together, cut them across into 1/2 inch chunks. Scrub the potatoes thoroughly
and don't peel them.  Cut into quarters and cut quarters twice so you get 12
bite size pieces from each tater.  Very slowly dryfry onion until it turns
light brown (slowly carmelizing the onions)Add cumin and coriander seeds, stir
for a minute, then add ginger, half garlic, chili powder, tumeric and cook
over very high heat, adding a couple of tablespoons of water as necessary
to keep the spice paste from sticking. Spices should deepen in color, this
should not take more than two minutes. Add eggplant, yogurt, sugar, and green
chilis. Mix all togetherand cook 2-3 minutes. Add 2/3 cup of water, lower
heat and and simmer 15 minutes, with lid firmly on. Add taters, peppers, and
tomatoes. Make sure lid is very tight, simmer another 10 minutes, checking
occassionally so it is not burning or sticking.. If too dry, add a bit more
water. Lastly, add cilantro, garlic, and lemon juice, cook 1 more minute,
gently stir to mix, then turn off heat.

             Pies, Crusts & Pastry
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  8             ounces  graham cracker crumbs -- or crushed cereal
  1         tablespoon  Apple butter -- or Pear spread, etc
  1                can  skimmed condensed milk
  3              whole  banana -- sliced
  8             ounces  fromage frais w/ quark -- or ff yogurt cheese

Instructions:

The day before, boil unopened can of milk for three hours - don't let it
boil dry whatever you do.  Allow to cool.  Make biscuit base by turning
the cereal into crumbs, melting the fruit butter in the microwave (only
about 30 seconds), mixing the two together and pressing down into the flan
dish.  Leave in the fridge to harden.  Please note that cereal crumbs
quicker than digestives/graham crackers do, so be prepared, or what you'll
have is powder!

Next day, open the can of milk, which will have turned to toffee, and
spread it over the biscuit base - which will try and stick to the toffee,
so just swoosh it round as best you can.  Top this with the sliced bananas,
and instantly with the cream substitute (if you hang about, the bananas
will go brown and ucky).  Refrigerate until wanted.

[(I sweeten this a bit with 2 TB of sweet oriental barbeque sauce, which
also gives it a slightly thick syrup consistency. I think your addition of
curry and ginger would give it a good zip.) By the way, this is a hit with
everyone and makes a good main dish for vegetarians while serving as a side
dish for others. Natalie Frankel]

Ingredients:
  1             medium  Acorn squash -- or other
                        winter squash of a similar size
     1/3           cup  Almonds -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  Olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  Onions -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  Thyme
  1                cup  barley -- cooked
  1         tablespoon  Tamari soy sauce

Instructions:

   Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and membrane and
  place the squash cut-side down on a lightly oiled baking dish. Bake
  at 350 degrees until the squash is still firm, but tender enough to
  easily scoop out with a spoon, about 45 minutes.

   After the squash has been baking about 25 minutes, place the chopped
  almonds in a pie tin or another small ovenproof container and bake
  until they turna toasty light brown (10-15 minutes). Check boththe
  almonds and the sqash occasionally so you will know when they are
  done.

   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and the thyme.
  Saute over low heat until the onions are well done. Add the cooked
  barley, tamari, and toasted almonds to the sauteed onions.

   Using a small spoon, scoop bite-sized chunks out of the cooked
  squash, leaving enough flesh around the shell so that it stays strong
  enough to hold its shape. Add the scooped out squash to the barley
  mixture. Mix well. Fill the empty squash shells with this mixture,
  mounding it as high as possible.

   Place the stuffed squash in a baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil
  and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.

Ingredients:
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- or less
     3/4           cup  carrot -- diced
  2         tablespoon  fresh basil -- chopped
     3/4           cup  celery -- chopped
     1/2           cup  onion -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  green onion -- chopped

  1 1/2          pound  chicken breast -- cut in 1/4" strips
                        or 1 lb turkey breast and 1/2 lb chicken
                        thigh without skin
  1 3/4           cups  barley, pearled -- about 12 ounces

     1/3           cup  parsley -- chopped
     1/4           cup  Parmesan cheese -- grated

Instructions:


Here's a wonderful recipe that appeared recently in Cooking Light.  It also called for 1 c water to be added with the broth--I left it out.  The original recipe called for 1 sprig thyme instead of the fresh basil that I used, and it called for 3/4 cup thinly sliced leek instead of the green onions.  Either way, I think you'll like this recipe. [Deb]

Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add carrot and basil;
saute 1 minute.  Add celery, green onion and onion; saute 1 minute.  Add
salt, pepper, and chicken; saute 5 minutes.  Add barley; saute 1 minute.

Add broth; bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 40 minutes.
Remove from heat.  Stir in parsley and cheese.  Yield: 9 servings, 1 cup
each.

Ingredients:
  1                cup  pearl barley -- medium
  2               cups  water
  2                     cucumber -- (kirby)
  1             medium  yellow squash
  1             medium  zucchini
     1/2           cup  nonfat mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  tarragon vinegar
     1/4           cup  fresh dill -- chopped
                        Salt and freshly ground black peper
  1              pound  pickled beets -- (1 jar)
                        (or 2 cups cooked slicedfresh beets)
                        Watercress for garnish

Instructions:

   Heat a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan; add the barley and cook the grain,
   stirring constantly, until it smells toasty. Remove the saucepan from
   the heat. Averting your face, add the water (it will bubble up furiously)
   Return the saucepan to the heat, cover and cook for about 2O to 25 minutes
   or until barley has absorbed the liquid and is just tender. Transfer the
   barley to a sieve and drain under cold water; pat dry and set aside.

   During the time it takes to cook the barley, peel, halve and seed the
   cucumbers and cut them into 1/2 inch half moons. Halve and seed the
   zucchini and yellow squash, cut them into 1/2 inch half moons and
   parboil them for a minute, drain and pat dry.

   In the bottom of a mixing bowl combine the mayonnaise, vinegar and
   dill; season well with salt and pepper. To the dressing add the cooked
   barley, cucumbers and squash and toss well; adjust the seasoning.

   On the outside edge of a serving platter, make a ring of drained
   sliced pickled beets. Pile the barley salad in the middle and center
   some watercress leaves in the middle of the salad.

   Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients:
  2                     bananas
  2        tablespoons  honey -- OPTIONAL
                        or maple syrup / golden syrup
  200                g  wholemeal self-raising flour
                        or 150g flour + 50g unprocessed bran

Put on baking tray in desertspoonful-lumps, then bake at 180C
(350F) for 15-20 minutes.

These cookies are made using mashed bananas instead of fat.  You can
substitute bananas (or applesauce) for fat in most cookie, cake and muffin
recipes - they're healthier and tastier.

They also make nice muffins if done in a muffin-pan - one quantity should
make about 12 baby muffins.  The following variations are all approximate
amounts - you can vary according to taste - and as you can see the
possibilities
are only limited by your imagination!

Recipe:      Basic Crockpot Beans
By:          FF Mailing List (Maureen O'Halloran) (reposted by Ellen C)
Prep Time:   2:40
Categories:  Crockpot
             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Information, Tips, Misc.
             Legumes

Ingredients:
  2              whole  onion -- chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  1              pound  dried beans -- soaked overnight
  1              whole  bay leaf -- up to 2
                        water to cover

Instructions:

                        See directions for spices and hints

Put in crockpot and cook about 4-6 hours on high or overnight on low.
Beans should be soft (small white beans take longest, pinto beans
shorter)

Add spices, vegies, etc. (see below) cook about another hour.

Spices:, vegies, etc:

1) 1 tsp dried cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1-2
Tbsp. soy sauce,   a few chili peppers, chopped, chopped green
pepper, can chopped tomotoes, some frozen corn. (Good with black beans)
1/2 tsp liquid smoke tastes good added.

2) 1 tsp cumin, 1 can chopped green chilis, chopped green pepper, 1
Tbsp soy sauce (good with white beans).

3) 1-2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/4 cup molasses, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp dried
mustard, (good with pinto or black eyed peas)

Garbanzo beans I usually use as a substiute in chicken recipes, so
I'll freeze them with just the onions and garlic.  Frozen black eyed
peas are also a good staple to have on hand (for some reason that's
the only legume that comes frozen except for lima beans which I don't
like).

It may seem like it takes a lot of time to cook dried beans, but the
actual effort involved is minimal.  Cover the beans with water to soak
all day or overnight.  Chop onions and garlic, throw it all in
crockpot (at this point I haven't even always decided what spices to
use).  When ready throw spices in and cook another hour: done.  Freeze

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  2               cups  bread flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3             cloves  fresh garlic -- minced or pressed
     1/2    tablespoon  olive oil
     2/3           cup  water -- lukewarm

Instructions:

[The original author's general directions for pizza dough-making are
quite lengthy and explicit; I include here only a portion of the
general directions for bread machines and for making dough by hand.
Her directions are more detailed, and include specific instructions
for using dough makers, food processors, and heavy-duty mixers with
dough hooks. I highly recommend the cookbook for any pizza-lover!]

If using a bread machine, add the ingredients in the order specified
for your particular machine. If your machine has a double kneading
cycle, remove the dough after an hour of rising and turn off your
machine; allowing the dough to knead a second time causes bubbles
which are difficult to roll.

If making by hand, proof the yeast in 1/4 to 1/3 of the water with a
pinch of sugar. Then add the remaining liquid ingredients, mix well,
then add the dry ingredients and stir until you can no longer work the
dough with a spoon. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured counter,
knead for 5 to 10 minutes, and allow to rise covered in a warm place
for 50 to 60 minutes.

For a thin-crust pizza, roll the dough out 1/8 inch thick; slightly
thicker at the edges. Turn the edges up slightly to prevent run-off in
the oven, and place toppings no closer than 1/4 inch to the edge of
the dough, preferably no closer than 1/2 inch.

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  wholemeal self-rising flour
  1                cup  rolled oats
  1                     egg -- or 2 egg-whites
                        skim milk
                        or buttermilk to make to correct
                        consistency
  1                cup  whatever to make yummy muffins (or two)

Instructions:

Method:
This is real easy: preheat the oven to 180C (350F); chuck everything into a
bowl; mix lightly (just until it looks blended - don't overdo it); then throw
spoonfuls into greased muffin pans, and bake for 15-20 minutes.

Variations:
see the Basic Cookies recipe for ideas - or make up your own,
for example, a cup of chopped dried fruit; a mixture of seeds - sesame, pumpkin
and sunflower; pumpkin and prunes; dates & walnuts; banana and ginger... I
could go on and on.  I often throw in leftovers from dinner to make savory
muffins for lunch at work - eg, vege pasta, chilli beans, mushroom and
artichoke sauce, etc.

You can also vary this by using different types of flour (rye, soya,
potato) and add a teaspoon of baking powder so they will still rise; or using bran (oat,
barley, rice) instead of the oats.

Recipe:      Basic Sourdough Starter

Categories:  Breads
             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegan
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  active yeast -- (1/2 Package)
  2               cups  warm water

Instructions:

First: see if you can get some from your friend instead!
Never let sourdough starter touch metal.  Use a wooden spoon and plastic,
ceramic or wooden bowl.

With a wooden spoon stir dry ingredients together and gradually add warm
water.  Stir until mixture resembles a smooth paste.  Cover with towel and set
in a warm place to sour.  Stir mixture several times a day.  In 2-3 days the
sourdough will be ready.

Store in a plastic container, with holes punched in the lid to allow gases to
escape.  I use a yogurt or margarine container with holes in the lid.

To make batter for a recipe, take out 1 cup stater and add 1 cup flour and 1
cup lukewarm water.  (I usually just use all of the starter and add 1 cup or
more of flour and water).  Stir with a wooden spoon.  Don't worry about the
lumps.  Cover and set in a warm location overnight (or at least for a few
hours).  Before you use the starter be sure to save at least 1/2 cup (add it
to any saved starter).  As soon as the lumps are gone it's ok to use the
batter.  If you leave it overnight it may seperate before morning, just stir
it back together.

Once a week replenish the starter this way.  I typically just put all of the
starter into a bowl and add 1/2 - 1 1/2 cup of flour and water. If I don't
intend to make bread I use just 1/2 cup, if I need alot of starter I use up to
1 1/2 cups.  The starter stays more "sour" if you leave it on the counter for
several days at a time and if you try not to add too much flour at any one
time.  However I have never gotten a truely sour sourdough out of this
starter (well, see additional notes below).

If the starter starts acting somewhat whimpy, add 1 tbl of yeast when you
replenish it.  Be sure to occassionally completely clean the container that
you use for storing the starter!

I find that the starter occassionally puts off a bit of grey liquid on the top
of the container.  I usually pour this off.  As the starter matures the amount
of grey liquid decreases.

There are other starters in this book, including one made from yogurt.  I'm
slightly reluctant to keep a yogurt starter going forever, but a friend claims
he had one he really liked.  I may try that as I prefer a good sour bread.

  3                 oz  sugar
  3                 oz  flour

Instructions:

[For a sponge cake one can, of course, make
the basic fat-free sponge - actually, fat-free is a misnomer as it
does contain eggs, but they mean no added fat - which is used for making
swiss rolls. Annabel]

Whisk eggs and sugar until light and whisk leaves a trail when lifted out
of the mixture.  Fold in flour.  Pour into greased and lined 12 x 8"
cake tin and spread evenly.  Bake at Mark 6 (200 C, 400 F) for 7-10
minutes.  Turn immediately on to a sheet of greaseproof paper, cut off
edges, spread with warm jam and roll up.

But you can make this cake in conventional sandwich tins, too, and
flavour with cocoa powder, or coffee, or whatever.

Instructions:

Heat stock in nonstick saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and onion; blend with a wooden spoon or whisk.

 Simmer over low heat for several minutes, stirring constantly.  Do not allow to brown.

 Remove from heat, add milks, bay leaf, thyme, white pepper, and vegetable seasoning.  Return to heat, stirring constantly until mixture coats the spoon.  If desired, add wine and simmer 5 minutes more to evaporate alcohol. [ahem .... this won't really get rid of all the alcohol -mrd]
 Remove onion and bay leaf.

 Cover and store until used, or place in an airtight container and refrigerate for several days, or freeze for future use.

 Serving Suggestions: This sauce be used over 8 cups of steamed vegetables such as broccoli florets, diced potatoes, quartered musrhooms, peas, asparagus, or sliced carrots.  To serve, place vegetables in a shallow ovenproof serving dish.  Drizzel sauce over vegetables, sprinkle with 2 T Sap Sago cheese or with Hungarian paprika and place under broiler to brown lightly before serving.

whisk a tablespoon of flour into a pint of liquid - skimmed milk
is ideal, but I sometimes use vegetable water into which I have dissolved
some skimmed milk powder, and that's even better.  Then bring to the boil,
stirring all the time, and allow to cook for a few minutes.  Season to
taste, according to the recipe.  I sometimes make this with a tin of
tomatoes, which I whisk with the flour in a food processor, so there's
no reason why you couldn't use fruit juice or something similar.

Instructions:

(serves 4)

It's from the National Fisheries Board,I think. I made it with orange roughy but you could use any firm, white
fish like cod or pollack.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Cut cod into serving size pieces. Pat dry. Place lemon juice and
olive oil in a baking dish that is big enough to hold all the fish
in one layer. Combine. Place cod in dish and turn to coat with
juice/oil.

Sprinkle cod with dried basil. Layer tomato slices on fish pieces.
Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper.

Cover dish with aluminum foil. Place in oven and bake for 10-15
minutes, depending on thickness of the fish.

Serve.

Ingredients:
  1              pound  shrimp -- peeled and deveined
                        (or 1 pound of scallops, rinsed)
  2             cloves  garlic -- chopped (2 to 3)
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil -- or 1 TBS dried
  1 1/2           cups  fresh tomatoes -- chopped
                        (roma or plum are best)
                        olive oil

Instructions:

This is my favorite easy seafood dish.  It can be made with scallops or
shrimp. [N. Fritz]

Saute the shrimp (or scallops) with garlic in 1 or 2 tsp of olive oil until
they loose their transparency (about 4-5 minutes max).  Add tomatos and basil,
and simmer 5 more minutes.  Serve over rice or pasta, with a sprinkle of
good fresh or shredded parmesan (the powdered stuff doesn't seem to do it).

*Use scallops if cholesterol is a major concern-they are lower than shrimp in
fat and cholesterol.

Instructions:

Soak Beans and Barley overnight.
Cook in a crock-pot or on medium-low
heat with enough water to cover, plus about an inch.
Add remainder of ingredients except salt, and simmer until red
beans are soft.  Salt to taste.

I also like to chop a couple of carrots for color. Celery can also be added.
This becomes a thick soup. Very tasty. Season with your favorite herbs or
spices. [Harold]

Ingredients:
  2               cans  pinto beans -- drained
                        or black beans
     1/2           cup  salsa

Instructions:

Put a can or 2 cups of drained cooked pinto or black beans through a
food mill or (second best) into a food processor.  Smoosh.  Starting
with about half a cup of salsa, your choice of hotness, smoosh it
through the food mill or the food processor.  If you used the food
mill, which will make it a little lumpier but remove the skins, stir
thoroughly to blend.  Taste, and add more salsa if it needs it.  Add
water if it's too stiff.

This can be multiplied almost indefinitely, depending on how big your
bowl or food processor is.  Keeps well.

I just discovered a really good reason to make your own--Guiltless
Gourmet costs $3.19 for that little jar.  Padrino's costs $2.29, by
the way.  I figure that the homemade version costs about $2.00 if you
use canned beans and a lot less if you cook them yourself (1 C beans,
2 C water, soak overnight, drain, add 2 C water, and simmer until the
skins burst when you blow on them in a spoon).  As I mentioned before,
I greatly prefer the texture of the food milled version and find
Guiltless Gourmet just a bit slimy or over-processed.  Be careful with
your food processor or you'll probably reproduce that texture.

Ingredients:
  1              pound  dried anasazi beans -- (soaked overnight
                        and cooked next day)
  1                can  green chiles
  1                can  jalapenos -- (to taste)
  1         tablespoon  cumin
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1                     minced garlic
  1                can  tomatoes -- or fresh
     1/2         block  nonfat mozzarella cheese

Instructions:

You can vary this quite a bit.  For instance, the original recipe called for
sauted onion, but I wanted to eliminate the fat, so I haven't put onions in.

After you cook the beans, drain off the liquid (reserve it though in case you
need to add moisture back).  Add the rest of the ingredients (again drain the
tomatoes if using canned ones).  Stuff your favorite tortillas.

I use to pre-cook these and then freeze them, but thought I'd try just
packaging them up and microwaving them.  They're fine.  It's great for work
lunches with salsa.

Instructions:


Mix together all ingredients except cheese.  Sprinkle cheese on
top.  Can melt cheese if desired.

I used medium hot salsa but next time I'll probably use hot
because this really isn't very spicy.  Adding more jalapeno
would make it spicier too.

Ingredients:
                        ****

Instructions:

I have no recipe as such but I will tell you how I make them:
I use *all* or *any*  legumes in turn, here in Australia we have several types
of beans...including lentils, chickpeas, etc....will not name them
as I know the names will not make sense to you in the US..

They come cooked in tins (475grs)  or you can cook your own.

I put a tin in a blender
add:
a spoon of tahini paste,
few drops of  lemon juice
a bit of mustard
a bit of cumin powder,
1/2 spoon of garlic paste
a bit of dried onions.

Now the *master* touches:

I add
 half of a small fresh raw capsicum (bell pepper in the US?)
1/2 of small (or whole if you prefer) cooked or nuked potato....
Optional....to suit taste on occassions I add 1 spoon of honey.

The last 3 steps came to me with experience and they add
a delicious flavor and texture.....

All spices can be added to taste and depending on the flavour of
the beans you are using...taste them as you open the can...
I alternate lentils, then chickpeas then 2 or 3 type of beans.....

I am sorry that I do not remember who it was that sugested sauteeing in
the microwave, but I want to thank you, whoever you were, and report that
it works beautifully.  I used that technique on this recipe.

The original recipe called for cooking this along with some beef soup
bones or short ribs.  I had intended to make some defatted beef broth and
use that instead of the water to cook it in, saving the beef to cut up in
my SAD eating husbands portion.  I may try this another time, although it
was quite delicious as it was.  I also think that when cooking it in the
crockpot, it would be OK to put all of the ingredients in at once in the
beginning instead of waiting to add the peas, lentils and barley later.

Ingredients:
                  ****

Instructions:


Selecting:
Look for smooth surfaces and bright colors.  Cracked seams or dull wrinkled
surfaces indicate dryness.

Storing:
Store in airtight glass jar away from heat.  Use within 6 months.

Freezing:
Cooked beans freeze very well, making time spent very worthwhile.

Very basic: 1 C beans to 4 C water,  pressure cook soaked beans.

Adzuki: boiling 2 hrs. or pressure cook for 30 min.  Lower in fat and easier
to digest than most beans.   Add cubes of peeled winter squash during the
last 30 min or splash with tamari and barley malt for an Oriental "baked
bean" dish.  Combine with brown rice and sauteed scallions, mushrooms and
celery for rice patties.

Black Turtle: 1 1/2 hrs boiling or 30 min pressure cooking.  A staple of
Latin American cooking.  Combine with cumin, garlic and orange juice in
soups or enchiladas.  Toss with olive oil, fresh cilantro and chopped
vegetables for a salad.  Combine with rice and nd cumin for a Cuban-style dish.

Black-eyed Peas: 1 - 1 1/4 hrs boiling or 25 min pressure cooking.
Traditionally served with rice ("Hoppin' John"), black-eyed peas can be
tossed with yogurt vinaigrette, tomatoes and fresh parsley.

Chick Peas (Garbanzos):  3 hrs boiling or 35 - 40 min pressure cooking.
Puree well-cooked chick peas with tahini, garlic, lemon, sea salt and olive
oil to make hummus.  Add cooked chick peas to salads, soups and pasta dishes.

Great Northern:  2 hrs boiling or 30 min pressure cooking.  Good in pasta
dishes with tomatoes, basil, parmesan cheese and olive oil.  Toss in Italian
soups or serve as a salad with a vinaigrette and roasted v vegetables.
Serve cooked with lamb or sausage dishes.

Red Kidney:  1 1/2 hrs boiling or 25 min pressure cooking.   Use in chili,
marinated salads and soups.  For refried beans, saute well-cooked kidney
beans in canola oil with garlic, onions, cumin and chili powder (place in
fresh tortillas).   Combine with tomatoes, mustard, onions and barley malt
for savory baked beans.

Red Lentils**: 20 - 25 min boiling avoid pressure cooking.  Combine with
olive oil, red onion and balsamic vinegar for a salad, or as a side dish
with fish or chicken or puree with basil, thyme and shallots.   Mix with
curry pasta to serve over couscous or rice.

Green Lentils**:  45 min boiling or 20 min pressure cooking.  Season green
lentils with tarragon in soups. Combine with olive oil, balsamic vinegar,
mustard, parsley and garlic as a salad.  Puree with cumin, ground ginger and
tumeric for an Indian dal.

Lima (baby):  1 1/2 hrs boiling or avoid pressure cooking.  Combine with
corn and green beans for succotash.  Add to minestrone soup.

Pinto:  2 1/2 hrs boiling or 30 min pressure cooking.  Combine beans with
onions, chili powder, garlic and tomatoes for chili enchiladas.  Saute
cooked beans in olive oil, garlic and tamari for refried beans. Place in
corn tortillas.

Navy:  2 1/2 hrs boiling or 20 - 30 min pressure cooking.   Navy beans make
a great soup with squash and kale.  Partially puree with basil, garlic and
tomatoes for a cool summer side dish.  Use in chili or as a salad with a
vinaigrette, red onions and olives.

Soy:  3 hrs boiling or avoid pressure cooking. Well-cooked soybeans can be
made into a sweet and sour dish with garlic, ginger, pineapple and tomatoes.

Yellow Split Peas**:  1 - 1 1/4 hrs. boiling or 25 min pressure cooking.
Good in curried dishes over brown basmati rice, or pureed in a mint and
garlic yogurt sauce, with lemon and cumin in soups.

Green Split Peas**:  1 - 1 1/4 hrs boiling or 25 min pressure cooking.  Most
often used in soups with tomatoes, carrots, celery and a touch of balsamic
vinegar.  Or puree with cumin, coriander and turmeric.  Serve with minted
yogurt for an Indian touch.

To prevent overcooking, check beans 10 min before these times have elapsed.

Salts, fats, sugars and acidic ingredients (tomatoes, wine) will extend
cooking time and harden skins, so add them near the end.

One pound of most dry beans measures 2 1/2 - 3 C and yields 6 - 7 C of
cooked beans.

Ingredients:
  1                can  beans -- chili, in sauce
                        or Ranchero beans
  1 1/2           cups  rice -- uncooked
     3/4         pound  skinless boneless chicken breast -- (to 1lb)

Instructions:


Prepare rice as directed, meanwhile cut up chicken into small chunks and
saute in a non-stick pan until cooked.  Add chicken and beans to rice and
heat through.  Serve with chopped fresh tomato, and fat-free sourcream
(tried Breakstone's FF sourcream-it was pretty good).  You can also
serve with pita bread or tortillas, but the tortillas have more fat than
I thought-2.5 grams per tortilla!  The pita has 0 grams.  I also served
steamed zucchini with a tiny sprinkle of fresh parmesan (2 teaspoons=2.5grams)

This will serve about 4, unless you are serving a hearty eater, and then you
get about 3 healthy servings. Each serving (for 4) has about 5 total grams
of fat, even with the cheese.

Instructions:

Finally, thanks to an idea in The Greatest Little Bean Cookbook by Tom
Chasuk (Hearst Books, 1995), I've got something that works for me:  "Beanut
Butter."  I take 1/4 C canned Great Northern beans, rinsed and drained.
These I mash in a dish with a fork.  Then I add 1 T peanut butter and mix.
The resulting Beanut Butter has 7 calories in 2 T and a miraculous 4 g of
fat!!  I won't exaggerate - peanut butter it's not.  But considering the fat
and calories savings, it's a darn good substitute.  I like it in PB& J
sandwiches (kids I know didn't notice the difference).  I don't recommend
Beanut Butter with crackers, but I do like it plain or with celery.  Hope it
works for you!!

Notes:  In order to dissolve the sugar I had to keep the beer &
        sugar mixture over medium heat while stirring.  Let me
        know if you run into the same problem.  This bread was
        very flavorful.  Gold recommends that people experiment
        with various types of beer, stout and ale.

  2               cups  water -- or vegetable stock

                        salt -- to taste
                        additional cilantro.

Instructions:

The following recipe is adapted from the New York Times magazine
section from a while back.

In this strictly vegetarian version (sanctioned by the NYT), it is
one of the few bean recipes that I make over and over.

Place beans in a bowl. Cover with cold water by 2 inches, add
thyme and let soak overnight, at least 4 hours.

Heat a heavy 2- to 3-quart casserole.  Add oil.

Sautee onion and carrot for about 10 minutes, until onions are translucent
and carrot soft.
Add jalapeno pepper, garli,c and cumin seeds, and cook a few minutes
longer.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees. (5)
Drain beans, and add to the casserole, together with
tomatoes, syrup, brown sugar, bay leaf, orange rind, peppercorns,
cilantro,
and water or stock.

Cover, and bring to a slow simmer.
Place casserole in oven, and cook for 1 hour.
Add vinegar and salt.

Cook 1 hour longer, until liquid has been absorbed, but the beans are
still moist.
Adjust seasoning - salt and pepper, and up to 2 more T vinegar.

Garnish with additional cilantro.

NOTES:
(1) I generally use white kidney beans.  Using all white beans gives
    a pleasing uniform color to the dish.  Just about any combination
    of dried beans can be used.

(2) Or, 1 heaping tablespoon of dried thyme.
    Just be sure to rinse it off completely.

(3) Or, to suit your tolerance.  I find that the peppers provide
    more of an undercurrent of heat than an outright fire, and so, too
    much is probably not a good idea in this dish. The hot pepper should
    act as a foil to the other sweet and sour components, not as an
    overpowering taste in itself.

(4) To toast cumin seed, heat a small saucepan, add the cumin and heat,
    shaking the pan, until the seeds begin to dance (pop) and smell
    toasty.

(5) I've made this recipe also in a crock pot and slow cooker with
    the same results.  It takes considerably more time to cook, so
    adjust the times accordingly.  Make sure the beans cook long enough
    to become tender.

             Southern
             Vegan
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        self-rising flour
                        Recipe on side of flour bag

Instructions:

As a Southerner (born & bred), I can tell you that the actual recipe has very
little to do with light, fluffy biscuits.  Just buy a bag of self-rising
flour and follow the basic recipe on the side of the bag.  Most are pretty
much the same - flour, solid shortening (Crisco) and buttermilk - it's all in
the technique.

The best biscuits I ever ate were made by an older woman I knew from work.
She was a widow, children grown & gone, so she used to invite my (ex)
husband and I to Sunday dinner.  She had been making biscuits since she was a
little girl, her mother insisted that if she never learned to cook anything
else in her life, no decent Southern man would ever marry a woman who
couldn't make biscuits <grin>. Not having a Southern mother myself, I watched
her intently, hoping to learn the secret.  I remember watching Mrs. Honeycutt
pour flour in a bowl, blend in Crisco with a pastry blender, then make a well
in the center and add buttermilk - all without any measuring utensils!  She
always mixed with her hands instead of a spoon, then turned out the dough
onto a floured surface, kneaded lightly and used a biscuit cutter to shape
the dough.  The biscuits then went onto a pan heavily greased with more solid
shortening (she said she wanted the bottoms to "fry" in the oven to give them
a crispy crust) and more shortening brushed on the tops.  Bake them in a very
hot oven and there you have it - Manna From Heaven.

Even though I've tried and tried over the years, my biscuits have never come
close to hers.  However, the tips she gave me are consistent with all of the
great Southern cooks I've known.  First, DO NOT USE Bisquick or other such
mixes.  They won't give you the results you're looking for and no
self-respecting Southerner would even have them in her kitchen <grin>.  Buy a
good quality brand of self-rising flour and follow the recipe for biscuits on
the side of the bag.  Keep the flour refrigerated between usage. (White Lily
brand is the most popular in this area, followed by Red Band, but they may be
regional brands).  Second, thoroughly blend in the shortening before adding
the buttermilk.  You should barely be able to tell you've added any fat to
the flour unless you run a little bit between your fingers.  There should be
little or no "crumbles" or lumps.  Use a pastry blender.  Third, mix in the
liquid lightly - only until moistened.  Then knead very gently - the less you
handle the dough the more tender the biscuits will be.  Lastly, invest in a
biscuit cutter or use a clean, empty can which has had both ends removed -
push down firmly and don't twist.  The air trapped inside a drinking glass
will push the dough down and result in a lower "rise".

I can guarantee that if you follow the standard recipe and make use of these
tips, you'll be utterly disappointed on your first few attempts.  Don't give
up!  Biscuit making is as much an art as a science but keep at it, the
results are well worth the effort.  Sorry this has been so long-winded, I
guess you can see how seriously we Southerners take our biscuits!

                        vegetable oil

Instructions:

For a 9" cake pan of biscuits (about 10), put two cups flour in a bowl.  Mix in enough buttermilk so that it holds together but is not dry (the wetter the better).  Drop this mixture onto a floured surface and pat it out until it's about 3/4 inch thick.  Cut out biscuits and place in greased pan.  Put a light coat of vegetable oil on tops of biscuits (maybe you can use a "Pam"-type spray, I've never tried it).  Bake in 350 oven for about 15 minutes.

                        Additional Cocoa
                        Powdered Sugar

Instructions:

TO MAKE MOUSSE:

In a small saucepan, combine gelatin and cold water and set aside to soften,
about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture just comes to a boil.  Remove from heat, add white
chocolate, and stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.  Pour
into a bowl and refrigerate until syrupy and starting to set, about 1 hour.

In a large bowl, beat egg whites until just foamy.  Add salt, vanilla, and
cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form when the beaters
are raised.  Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the
mixture forms stiff peaks, about 4 minutes.

Remove cooled white chocolate mixture from the refrigerator and gently fold
in the beaten whites.  Return mousse to the refrigerator for at least 1
hour, or until ready to assemble torte.

TO MAKE THE CAKE:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut a piece of wax paper or parchment to fit
the bottom of a 9X9" baking pan.  Spray pan, line with paper, and spray again.

In a medium bowl, sift together flour, 1/3 cup of the sugar, cocoa, and
salt.  Set aside.

Combine remaining sugar with eggs and beat with an electric mixer at high
speed until mixture is pale yellow and forms soft peaks when beaters are
raised.  Beat in vanilla and chocolate liqueur.

Sprinkle flour mixture over egg mixture a few tablespoons at a time, folding
gently after each addition, until all flour mixture has been incorporated.
Pour into prepared pan and bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean. Invert cake onto a piece of wax
paper and let cool.

TO ASSEMBLE CAKE:

Wash and dry the cake pan.  Tear off 2 sheets of plastic wrap at least 16
inches long.  Use the sheets to line the cake pan, crossing them over one
another, and allowing wrap to extend over pan sides.

When cake is cool, cut into 2 equal layers, using a long-bladed serrated knife.

Spread half of the white chocolate mousse evenly over the bottom of the
plastic lined pan.  Place 1 cake layer gently over the mouse, spread with
remaining mousse, and top with remaining cake layer.  Wrap with plastic wrap
and freeze for at least 4 hours, or overnight.

BEFORE SERVING, peel back plastic wrap from top of cake, invert onto a piece
of wax paper, and carefully remove plastic.  Dip a long knife in warm water
and wipe it off.  Carefully trim each side of the torte, dipping and wiping
the knife after each cut.

Using a fine sieve, dust top of cake [a mousse layer] with cocoa.  Cover
cake top with a decorative stencil and dust with powdered sugar.  Carefully
lift stencil off cake.  Return cake to freezer until ready to serve.  [Cake
will keep in a covered container for up to 6 weeks.]

TO SERVE CAKE:

Using the dip and wipe method, cut cake in half, then cut each half into
four slices.  Serve immediately.

  1                Can  tomatoes with green chilis -- ie, Ro-Tel
                        (10 oz)  NOT drained  (2 1/4 C)
  1              Large  yellow onion -- (or white) chopped
  1           Teaspoon  chili powder
  1         Tablespoon  ground cumin
  3        Tablespoons  lime juice
     1/4      Teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1               Dash  cayenne pepper
                        salt to taste

Instructions:

Thoroughly, but gently, mix everything together. Allow to sit at least 4
hours, preferably overnight.  This *definitely* gets better as it sits!!!

             Vegan
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
     1/2         pound  dried black beans -- rinsed (I used 1
                        cup)
                        water for soaking and cooking beans
                        ***
     1/3           cup  vegetable broth -- or liquid for saute
     1/2                onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2                green bell pepper -- chopped
     1/2                jalapeno -- chopped (1/2 to 1)
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin

Instructions:

Cover beans with water and soak overnight in heavy pot. Drain.  Add enough
fresh water to pot to cover beans by 4 inches. Boil until just tender,
about 1 hour.

Heat broth or water in heavy skillet over med. heat. Add onion,  bell
pepper, garlic and  jalapeno. Saute till tender, about 6 minutes. Add onion
mixture to beans.

Stir in honey, vinegar, chili powder and cumin. Simmer over low heat till
beans are very tender and liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally about
45 minutes. The more liquid that gets absorbed, the better off you will be
when the mixture has to be cooked until it dries out. Don't cook out all
the liquid though. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill)

Puree beans. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to non-stick skillet.
Stir over med. heat until very thick and dry, kind of mashed potato
consistency. Here's where my recipe differed from the posted one. It said
that it would take 4 minutes, it took me over 30 minutes but that may have
been since I didn't cook out all the liquid.

Cool.

Form bean puree into six 2-inch diameter cakes. Spray nonstick pan with
PAM-like substance. Heat over med. heat. Cook cakes till brown, about 4
minutes per side. Be careful turning them over, they don't become solid
when they cook.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  12                    Corn Tortillas
  1                     Onion -- chopped
  10            ounces  chicken Stock -- or any stock
  3             cloves  garlic -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  Cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  Chili powder
  2             pounds  Cooked black beans
                        or 3 (14 oz each) cans kidney beans -- drained
                        beans drained
  15            ounces  Tomato sauce -- flavoured with
                        -- pinch cayenne and pinch cumin
  8             ounces  mozzarella cheese -- finely shredded
  6                 tb  Parmesan cheese
                        Chopped fresh coriander
                        Lime wedges

Instructions:

  1.  Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees F, 150 degrees C, gas mark 2.

  2.  Bake the tortillas directly on the oven shelf for 15 to 20 minutes,
  turning once until crisp right through.  They will break with a clean
  snap.  Break into coarse pieces and set aside.

  3.  Spread onion pieces out in a heavy frying pan.  Cook over moderate
  heat without stirring until the onions are sizzling and beginning to stick
  to the pan.  Stir in the stock and let it bubble up, stirring up the
  browned deposits in the pan as it bubbles.  Stir in the garlic and the
  spices.  Turn the heat down and simmer, stirring frequently until the
  mixture is thick, not at all soupy, and the onions and spices are frying
  in their own juices.  Don't rush this step.  It is essential that the
  spices should not have a harsh raw taste.

  4.  Stir in the black beans and heat gently.  Mash roughly while still in
  the pan, with a potato masher.  You want a rough lumpy mixture, not a
  smooth puree.  Set aside.

  5.  In a gratin dish spread a layer of a third of the tortilla pieces.
  Spread a layer of the black beans over the tortillas and spread a third of
  the tomato sauce over the black beans.  Sprinkle with one third of the
  cheeses.  Repeat this, ending with a layer of the beans, sauce and
  cheeses.

  6.  Bake for 30 minutes covered.  Uncover, and bake for 5 to 10 minutes
  more.  Serve garnished with lime wedges.

Instructions:

Combine all ingredients in a large pot and simmer for about an hour. Add
pepper and tabasco sauce to taste. You could also add a can of corn, or a
can of spinach, or some potatoes for texture. Another idea for making a
"meaty" chili is to add rice for heartiness.

     1/2           cup  lowfat sour cream

Instructions:

Cookbook part of "Favorite Brand Name Recipes series".

"Here is a recipe that I make very often and always get rave reviews." [Sudeshna]

Yields 2-1/4 cups; serving size 2 tblsp.
Procedure: Mash beans with a fork.  Stir in everything else untill
well mixed.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Goes well with
tortilla chips, carrots, celery etc.

Note:  I usually use fat free sour cream (I think fat free yougurt
would work fine too), fresh garlic, fresh green serrano chillies,
about 3 to 4 tblsp of cilantro and skip the chilli powder.  I also use
a blender to blend everything instead of mashing with a fork.  That
depends on how smooth you like your dip.  A food processor would
do a great job.  So go ahead and use it if you have one.

                        fresh cilantro
                        cumin or chili powder

Instructions:

Mix beans and corn (drain corn first). Add salsa until it reaches right
consistency (I like it moist, so I usually add 1 to 1.5 cups, and I use
medium salsa).  Season to taste with lime (about 2 tsp), Cilantro (about
2-3 tablespoons, chopped), and cumin (about 1 tsp).  Serve with baked
tortilla chips - this goes over really well at parties as a dip, but I also
like it as a side dish.
Adding more cilantro and/or lime will give it more zing, and using chili
powder will give it a little more spiciness.

toss together, and chill for several hours. it's easy, very pretty, and quite

Ingredients:
  2                  C  Black Beans
  2 1/2             Qt  Water
  2               Tbsp  Chicken Bouillon Cube
     1/4           Cup  bacon bits -- imitation
  1              Pinch  Mustard Powder
  1                Cup  Onion -- minced
     1/2           Cup  Celery -- minced
     1/2         Ounce  Butter Buds(r) -- dry
     1/2         Ounce  Lemon Juice
  2        Tablespoons  Red Wine

Instructions:

Here are some more soup recipes heavily adapted from The Jack Spratt
Cookbook by Polly Zane:

Soak beans in water 4 hours or over-night.  Do not drain.  Add all
remaining ingredients except Butter Buds, lemon juice and wine.  Cook for
2-3 hours till beans are soft and mushy.  If you prefer a smooth soup,
blend and return to pan.  Just before serving, mix wine with lemon juice,
whisk in Butter Buds and add to hot beans.

I did not blend mine; I liked the whole beans.  I actually cooked mine
much longer than 3 hours because I just left it to simmer while I
was gone from the house and I was gone longer than I had expected to be.
 It didn't seem to hurt it any.  I think that this might be a good
candidate for all day in the the crock pot. This
was good the first day and even better reheated the next day for lunch.

Ingredients:
  1              Pound  black turtle soup beans
  1              Whole  onion -- peeled, chopped
  1             Medium  carrot -- peeled, chopped
  1              Stalk  celery -- choppped
  6             Cloves  garlic
  1                     bouquet garni (parsley -- thyme, tarragon,
                        bayleaf, wrap
  1                 In  cheesecloth -- tie as packet)
  1              Whole  ham bones
  2             Quarts  chicken stock -- (to 3)
  1         Tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         Tablespoon  ancho chili powder
     1/2           Cup  sour cream
  2        Tablespoons  milk
                        salt
     1/2             C  salsa

Instructions:

Rinse and sort the beans.  Soak overnight in cold water.  Put
  beans, onion, carrot, celery, garlic, bouquet garni, ham bone,
  chicken stock to cover in large pot.  Bring to a boil, skim off
  any scum that rises to the surface.  Simmer slowly, loosely
  covered, about 2 hrs, until beans are tender.  Add more stock
  if the level falls below surface of beans.  Stir often.

  When beans are cooked, puree them.  Mix puree with cumin and chili
  powder.

  Mix sour cream and milk until smooth.

  Heat bean puree, adding more stock to get a consistency that will
  pour out of a ladle like thin cereal.  Season.  Pour into warm
  soup plates.

  Garnish with sour cream drizzled over each, salsa in the center.

  NOTE: Very good without ham bone, and with vegetable broth instead
  of chicken broth.  We like yogurt as well as sour cream.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        SOUP :
  1              pound  dried black beans -- picked over,
                        -- rinsed, and soaked for 10 hours
                        -- or longer in water to cover
                        -- by at least 4 inches
  6               cups  beef broth -- (I use veg. broth)
  8               cups  water
  28            ounces  canned tomatoes -- chopped, with juice
  2          teaspoons  cumin -- (I used ground)
                        Salt to taste -- optional
                        Black pepper to taste
                        JALAPENO CREAM: -- optional
     2/3           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
  1                     jalapeno -- (1 to 2)
                        --or- pickled jalapenos -- seeded and minced
  3        tablespoons  fresh parsley -- minced
  1         tablespoon  cilantro -- minced, optional
                        GARNISHES: -- optional
     1/2           cup  red onion -- chopped
     1/2                avocado -- peeled, seeded, and
                        chopped

Instructions:


Here is a great black bean soup.  (I've tried many and this makes a hit
with the most people.  Those that don't like jalapeno just don't put the
jalapeno cream on top.  It is still wonderful.)[Kay]

Serves 6-8 main course  or 8-10 first course

Prep. tip.  You can prepare the soup up to 4 days in advance and store
it, covered , in the refrigerator.  Or you can freeze it.  The jalapeno
cream can be prepare 1 or 2 days ahead.

Serving suggestions: In addition to the jalapeno cream, try garnishing
the soup with chopped red onion and/or chopped avocado.

1. Drain the beans, and put them in a large, heavy pot.  Add the broth
and water.  Bring the beans to a boil, stirring them a few times, reduce
the heat, and simmer the beans in the uncovered pot for 1 hour.

2. Stir in the tomatoes with their juice, and the cumin, and continue
simmering the beans for 2 hours or until the beans are soft (check after
1 and 1/2 hours, since the timing depends on dryness or age of the beans.)

3.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and let the mixture cool
briefly.  Rinse out the pot. Then puree the mixture in batches in a
blender or food processor until the mixture is smooth, returning the
puree to the pot as you go.

4. Season the soup with the salt and pepper.  Bring soup to a simmer.  If
the soup is too thin, simmer it in the uncovered pot, stiffing it often,
until the desired consistency is reached.

5. To prepare jalapeno cream, whisk together the yogurt, jalapenos,
parsley and cilantro.  Serve a dollop of the cream atop each bowl of
soup..  If you wish add the other garnishes. (Red onion and avocado.)

                        cooking liquid -- as needed
                        (equals: 1 lb cooked black beans
                        Add:
  1                     onion -- or two
  1                     garlic clove -- or two chopped

Instructions:

(I use a stewed tomato product - Italian or Mexican style - because it has pear
tomatoes in it. These tomatoes don't cook away, but stay in little
chunks.  Also extra stuff in the can for flavoring doesn't hurt. )
.Cook until beans are tender.

Sometimes I also add a handful of wildrice in addition to the brown
rice to the pot.

I like to serve fat free flour torillas with above beans  because I
like to "dip".  My daughter uses the beans for burritos.  Or I add a
good bread and a salad to complete meal.

Add honey and tofu and blend again.  Set aside 2 C of the mixture for the
vanilla icing for top and sides of the cake.  To mixture still in blender,
add melted chocolate and 3 T syrup.  Blend again until smooth.  Chill both
icings before using.

TO ASSEMBLE:
Carefully remove the two top layers of cake.  Brush some syrup onto bottom
layer, and spread half the chocolate icing on it.  Place the middle cake
layer on top.  Brush with more syrup, and spread the rest of the cholocate
icing over it.  Put down a layer of cherries, and dot with a little of the
vanilla icing to help the top layer stick.  Place the top layer on the
cheries, and brush again with syrup.  Frost top and sides of cake with
vanilla icing, decorate with cherries and pipe rosettes with a pastry bag,
if desired.

Chill several hours before serving.  The cake can be kept covered if not
being served until the following day.  However, the frosting tends to
discolor after about three days.

NOTE: I left out of the icing 3/4 C raw cashews and 3 oz. semi-sweet
chocolate, melted.

Ingredients:
                        -- 1 1/2 Lb: -- 1 lb. loaf
  1 1/8           cups  Water -- (3/4 C.)
  1 1/2           cups  Bread Flour -- (2/3 C.)
  1                cup  Rye Flour -- (2/3 C.)
  1                cup  Whole Wheat Flour -- (2/3 C.)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Salt -- (1 tsp.)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Oil -- (1 T.)
     1/3           cup  Molasses -- (3 T.)
  3        tablespoons  Cocoa Powder -- (2 T.)
  1         tablespoon  caraway seed -- (2 tsp.)
  2          teaspoons  Yeast -- (2 tsp.)
                        (Red Star)

Instructions:


For Ellen,  I think you could use almost any bread recipe for filling with dip.  Here is the "traditional" version - pumpernickel.  It is a little more dense than some breads.  I use SAF instant yeast and always use a scant T. for 1-1/2 lb. loaves.  You might want to add some vital wheat gluten to make this a less-dense loaf.  It is truly delicious and is the only pumpernickel I make.  You can also substitute applesauce or another fat substitute for the oil, but it is pretty low already.

Directions: Use Light Crust setting
Cool 1 hour before slicing.
You can add 1 tsp. instant EspressoPowder for flavor.
Bread may also be done on dough cycle, then finished in the oven.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        BLETLACH (LEAVES):
     1/2      teaspoon  Salt
  2               cups  Flour
  1                cup  Water
  1                cup  Skim Milk
  2               cups  egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
                        or- equivalent to 8 eggs
                        Pam -- or similiar cooking
                        spray
                        FILLING:
  1 1/2         pounds  farmer's cheese -- or Dry Cottage
                        Cheese,or Pot Cheese
  8             ounces  NonFat Cream Cheese
  4        tablespoons  NonFat Sour Cream
     1/2           cup  egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute -- or equivalent to 2
                        eggs
  1              pinch  salt and pepper -- to taste

Instructions:

BATTER:

1. In a blender, put the the flour with the salt; add eggbeaters, add water
& milk gradually to
until batter is smooth and thin.

2. Heat a small frying pan, Teflon makes life easy, and spray with Pam.

3. When pan is hot, put in about 1/4 cup batter, tilt pan until the batter
covers it
all over.  Cook until it begins to blister and is shiny.

4. Turn out on a towel on a table. Continue until all the batter is used.
Should make about 24
circles.

FILLING:

1.  In a large bowl, break up the farmers' cheese, and the nonfat cream
cheese, and with a fork
mix together, add the eggbeaters, salt & pepper and continue to mix.  Slowly

add up to 4 tbpsn
of non-fat sour cream, mixing completely.

Now it's time to 'build your blintzes'.

2. Put some filling off center on each circle. Fold the bottom up; the two
sides in
and then roll over to the top. Place on a plate face down and chill for at
least an hour
before. Confused? Just try it, it's easy.

3. At this point you can store them  in  the fridge, or freeze them. They
freeze well.

4. To finish, just fry them in a pan sprayed with pam or a small amount of
butter, until browned
on each side. Great, served  with Non fat sour cream. They are a bit
complicated, but not really
difficult. and they freeze so well. Use well seasoned 6 inch pans.

NOTE: If you freeze them; zap in the nuke for about 30 to 60 seconds BEFORE
frying.  These taste so much better then store bought and it really isn't
hard. Mrs. Radis manufactures them by the dozen and always keep them in the freezer.

- Rinse but don't dry a 9x14 (inch) cake pan & pour the mix into it.
- Chill until set, about 2 hours.

Notes on variations:
Try Chinese sweet rice or A variation invented out of desperation when I
ran out of couscous was to use 1 c. McCann's noninstant oatmeal (I think
same as steel cut oats) + 2c. couscous.  I liked it even better this way!
Also different juices (I keep running out
of stuff) mixed in w/the apple juice makes it interesting.  [Aiko Pinkoski]

Variations:
Use strawberries in place of blueberries, top with unsweetened fruit jam
thinned with
a little water, arrange fruit slices on top for decoration.

Recipe:      Blueberry Muffins

Ingredients:
  2 1/4            cup  oat bran
  1               Tbsp  baking powder
     1/4           cup  honey
  1                cup  blueberries
  2                     bananas
  1 1/4            cup  skim milk
  2                     egg whites
  2               Tbsp  corn syrup

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 425 F.  Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl.  The
blueberries too, it keeps them from staining the ingredients.  Mash
the bananas in a separate bowl and mix the milk, egg whites, honey, and corn
syrup together, then blend with the dry ingredients.  Line muffin pans
with paper baking cups, and fill with batter.  Bake about 15 minutes.
Makes 12 muffins.

***HINTS***  I found that if you try to eat these straight from the oven
they tend to stick to the paper.  They keep great for a week though
in the frig without sticking.  If you eat 3 of these a day, it is
suppose to be a sufficient amount of oatbran to significantly lower
your cholesterol. So far, I haven't seen much of a difference in my
own, but that is just me and I am still trying.  Also, if you use
a 1/4 cup measure to scoop out the batter, it pretty much evenly
distributes the batter amoung the 12 cups.

***Variations****  I have tried the following substitutions in many
combinations and these are still good.  raisens instead of blueberries
or no fruit at all, 1/4 c brown sugar instead of 1/4 c honey, no bananas,
one banana, 2 Tbsp of canola for 2 Tbsp of corn syrup although I wouldn't
recommend this for obvious reasons.

Also, you could try 2 cups of oatbran and 1/2 cup apple fiber.  I have
not tried this yet, but will the next time I make muffins.  I FINALLY
found apple fiber (no, not apple pectin) yesterday at a hfs thanks
to my friend Jen who happens to be on this list!!  Apple fiber is an
even better fiber than oatbran, and therefore even better for lowering
LDL and raising HDL!

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2                     Egg Whites
     3/4             C  Sugar
     1/2             C  Applesauce
     1/2             C  Skim Milk
  1               Tbsp  Maple Syrup
  1                Tsp  Vanilla
  2                  C  Flour
  1               Tbsp  Baking Powder
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  1 1/4              C  Blueberries, Frozen -- or fresh, wild Maine
                        -- (used 1 1/2 C)

Instructions:

Set the oven to 375 degrees.
Thoroughly grease a muffin tray with 12 large muffin cups and set
aside until ready to use (I just use a nonstick muffin pan).

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until frothy.
Add the sugar and beat for 1 minute.  Stir in the applesauce, milk,
maple syrup and vanilla.

Add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix just until the dry
ingredients are moistened.  Gently fold in the blueberries.  Spoon the
batter into the greased muffin cups and bake in the preheated oven for
20 - 25  minutes or until golden and the center springs back when
gently pressed.

Remove the muffins from the oven and set on a metal cooling rack for
10 - 20 minutes.  Using a knife, cut around each muffing and gently ease
them out of the pan, making sure they don't fall aparat (these need to
be cool to remove from the pan).  (I use a small plastic knife since
my pan is nonstick, they are easy to take out when lukewarm).  Set
on the cooling rack.

Makes 12 muffins.

This is yet another blueberry muffin recipe but a really
great one. These come out like the fluffy soft ones you
buy in the stores :-)

Ingredients:
  2              whole  banana -- very ripe
  1                cup  corn flour
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  honey

     1/2           cup  water -- or nonfat milk,
                        juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Ener-G egg replacer -- or 1 egg white
     1/4      teaspoon  guar gum -- or other thickener
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda -- or slightly less

     1/2      teaspoon  cardamom -- or more
  1 1/2           cups  blueberries -- fresh

Instructions:

Preparation: Mash bananas with a potato masher, add all remaining ingredients,
except for blueberries.  Stir well.  Lightly oil a small pan, or 8 muffin tin,
by dipping a paper napkin in a drop of oil and spreading this all over the
baking surface (or spray with Pam).  Pour batter into pan (8" x 5") or muffin
tin.  Sprinkle top with blueberries, the more the better.  Blueberries won't
sink to the bottom, so you have to press them down if you want to get even more
of them in.  Bake at about 400F for about 25-35 minutes, my guess.  Serve warm.
This will taste quite rich, the warm melted blueberries get runny and yummy!

  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda

  1                cup  fresh blueberries -- (or any berries )
     2/3           cup  buttermilk
                        (or 2/3 cp skim milk with tbs of vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  molasses

Instructions:

Mix first 4 ingredients in a large bowl, and cut in the butter (cottage cheese)
until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Combine milk and molasses, and add to
dry mix with blueberries.  Stir until just combined.  Place on floured board
or on cookie sheet sprayed with nonstick spray, and pat into a circle 1 inch
think.  Cut into wedges (8 or 10), separate slightly if on cookie sheet, and
if on board, transfer to prepared cookie sheet.  Bake at 450 for about 12
minutes until lightly browned.

****NOTE**** I like my scones a little sweet, so I would add 1/4 cp sugar or
a few tablespoons of honey next time.  These are more like biscuits in
taste.

Add the water to the sugar and boil until the syrup spins a thread. Pour the hot
syrup very slowly into the beaten white of egg, whip
ping constantly. Flavor with vanilla and spread the icing on the cake. For
chocolate icing, add 2 Tbsp grated chocolate to the warm i
cing. To tint icing:  Lemon juice will whiten icing. The grated rind of an
orange will give a yellow color. Strawberry, raspberry or
cranberry juice will give a pink shade. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book -

Categories:  Cakes & Frostings
             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegan
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar (I use 1/8)
  1                cup  warm water -- divided in half
  4        tablespoons  Wilton Meringue Powder
  3 1/2           cups  sifted confectioners sugar (I just whisk
                        the stuff before
                        measuring)

Instructions:

Again, have all utensils completely grease-free.

With a heavy-duty mixer whip meringue powder with 1/2 cup water for 7
minutes at high speed.  Blend in confectioners sugar at low speed,
then beat 4 minutes at high speed.  Cover with a damp cloth
(important).

In a saucepan (use one larger than you think you need), cook
granulated sugar, cream of tartar, and 1/2 cup water over medium to
high heat, stirring constantly (I use medium; the recipe says high).
When the mixture boils, stop stirring; brush sides of the pan down
with warm water to remove sugar crystals (Joy of Cooking recommends
covering the pot and boiling for three or four minutes to do this, and
I have found it works very well indeed).  Use a candy thermometer, and
boil until it reaches 240 degrees (245 for stiffer icing; this
corresponds to between soft and hard ball stages).  Remove from heat
and slowly add to whipped mixture, beating at low speed.  Whip at high
speed for 5 minutes.  Keep covered with a damp cloth while using.

Note: this icing must be used immediately.  Do not store.

The note at the top says "Use for icing cakes and all decorating
techniques"; however, I would be a bit skeptical of using it for
things requiring a lot of body, like roses.  It does dry out, and that
fairly quickly, so after you finish keep the cake in a cake box or
something else to hold in humidity.

One last note: I hope no one thinks this stuff is less fattening than
the normal icing (at least significantly).  Simple sugars are simple
sugars, and you can't lose weight by eating like this every meal.
However, for a splurge I guess it is better than all that hydrogenated
oil.

Ingredients:
     1/4         pound  bacon -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  6             cloves  garlic -- finely chopped

  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1                cup  chicken broth -- (or beef broth)
  1                cup  dry white wine
  4               cups  canned tomatoes -- (Italian)
                        with juice
  1                can  tomato paste -- (small)
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        freshly ground pepper
  1         tablespoon  oregano
  1               dash  red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- freshly grated

Instructions:

In a small skillet or frypan, fry the bacon.  Drain off the fat as
it accumulates in the pan.  Remove from skillet when bacon is
leathery but not yet crisp.  Distribute bacon on one or two paper
towels, roll them up, and give them a good squeeze so the paper
absorbs most of the remaining bacon fat.  Set aside.  Heat the oil
in a deep, heavy non-aluminum kettle (an enameled cast iron
casserole or large skillet will do) and add the vegetables.  Cook,
stirring, over low heat until the onions are translucent and the
vegetables are softened.  Add the beef, using a wooden spoon to
break up any lumps.  Cook only until the meat loses its raw red
color.  Do not let it brown.  Add the cooked bacon, broth, and
wine, raise the heat, and cook until the sauce thickens a little.
Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, oregano, pepper
flakes, and nutmeg, and stir well.  Taste and adjust the
seasonings.  When the sauce begins to bubble, lower the heat and
simmer very slowly, partly covered, for about 4 hours.  Stir
occasionally to prevent sticking.  Before serving, taste again for
seasoning and adjust.

This sauce freezes well and keeps for about a week in the
refrigerator.  If you cannot find lean ground beef, pick out a
round steak or some sirloin and have the butcher trim and grind it
for you.  And remember, don't cook with wine you wouldn't drink!

Instructions:

This was really good.  Will make it next time without the chicken and then I think it could be used for a main, side, dessert or even a breakfast dish...it seems really versatile.[Reggie]

Cut filets in 2" cubes.  In heavy bag, combine flour, 1/2 t curry powder,
paprika, italian seasoning and chicken pieces tossing to coat chicken
thoroughly.

In med-large skillet over med-high heat, stir-fry chicken in 2 T broth for
about 10 min, until chicken is no longer pink inside.  Remove from pan.

Preheat oven to 350 deg F.

Add garlic, onion and 2 T broth to skillet and cook, stirring often, 5 min
or until the garlic and onion begin to color.  Stir in apples, remaining 1 t
curry, raisins, lemon juice and oranges with juice.  Cover and cook over med
heat for 10 min.

Remove skillet from heat.  Set aside 1 C of the fruit mixture for topping;
stir cooked rice into remaining fruit mixture.

Bake uncovered at 350 deg F for 20 - 30 min, until liquid is absorbed and
casserole is golden brown.

This is EXCELLENT!!

NOTE:
I am going to make this next time without the chicken but use everything
else in the recipe.  I think it would make a wonderful side dish, breakfast
or dessert.  It seems like it is versatile enough to be able to do this and
use it for just about any meal.

Instructions:

I was requested to post some recipes from "500 FatFree Recipes" by
Sarah Schlesinger. Here is the first (maybe the last tonight!).
Lest you think that this cookbook is heavily into pasta and bread, the
recipes preceding this one, all in the Main Dishes section, were:

Cooked bow tie pasta is served with a spicy eggplant sauce in this
dish. Serve with Corn and Green Bean Salad (page 231).

1. Heat water, broth, or wine in a large heavy saucepan over medium
heat. Add garlic, onion, and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir over medium
heat for 5 minutes. Add the eggplant, reduce heat to low, and continue
cooking and stirring until it begins to soften. Since the eggplant
tends to absorb liquid, be prepared to add additional water during
this process.

2. Add the tomatoes, basil, and oregano. Cover and simmer for 20
minutes or until the eggplant is tender.

3. Toss eggplant sauce with the bow tie pasta and serve.

             Meats

Ingredients:
  2             pounds  beef chuck roast
  1         tablespoon  olive -- or canola oil
  2              large  onions -- cut in eighths
  8                     carrots -- cut in 2" pieces
  4             stalks  celery -- cut in 2" pieces
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar -- (or 1 c red wine)
  1 1/2           cups  beef stock -- (lowfat)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  salt and pepper

Instructions:

Serves 6.

Trim fat from beef. Cut a length of kitchen string about four times the
length of the roast and wrap once around the length, then around width
several times, tying where it comes together.

In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over moderately high heat. Brown beef on
all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add vegetables to pan and saute for about
7 minutes or until browned and slightly softened. Transfer to a plate.

Return beef to pan. Add wine vinegar, stock, herbs, salt and pepper. Stir
to blend. Cover and simmer gently about two hours, turning meat every 30
minutes.

Return vegetables to pot, cover, and simmer about 15 minutes, or until
beef is very tender. Discard bay leaf. Slice meat and arrange on platter
surrounded by vegetables. Serve with pot juices.

NOTES: There's more fat in this than I usually like for a meal, but we use
it for special occasions.

I fix it in a teflon-lined pan and use just a short spray of Canola oil.
I also use bottom round roast instead of chuck, to cut down even more on the
fat content. Using bottom round you can skip the string tie. It isn't
needed. We also prefer wine vinegar to wine. It adds a lovely tang to the
recipe. [Nadine]

Ingredients:
                        Mix:
  2               Cups  100% Bran(r) cereal
  1 1/4           Cups  skim milk
     1/3           Cup  brown sugar -- firmly packed
                        Let stand 5 minutes.
                        Meanwhile combine in a large bowl:
  1                Cup  flour
  2          Teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      Teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      Teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           Cup  cranberries -- dried
                        To the cereal mixture add:
  1                     egg
     1/2           Cup  applesauce

Instructions:

I may have posted it some
time ago. This is a recipe I modified from a Nabisco coupon.  I discovered
that I really like Kellogg's 100% bran better--I think it's less sweet.  I
have added the dried cranberries (raisins would also work) and use
unsweetened applesauce (it's sweet enough without it) and half whole wheat
flour. I changed the milk from lowfat to skim.  I also double the recipe,
freeze the muffins, and take frozen muffins to work with me to eat when I
arrive--they're thawed by the time I get to work about an hour later.

Heat oven to 400 degrees F.


Add the flour mixture and stir until just moistened (batter will be lumpy).
Spoon batter into  muffin pan sprayed with cooking spray or lined with
foil or paper cups, filling each cup 2/3 full.  Bake for 18 to 20 minutes
or until golden brown.  Makes 12.

The original recipe said each muffin has 120 calories and 2 g fat.  My
changes decrease the fat and probably alter the calories somewhat.

          (Note: if using 'juicy' fruits like berries, decrease
          applesauce/prune puree to 1 Tbsp, unless you like *really*
          moist muffins!)

Here is a recipe for Bran Muffins that I just can't seem to get enough
of lately :) It was originally on the back of a box of Quaker Oat Bran
Hot Cereal (tm), but since the cereal's only ingredient is oat bran, I
don't see why it wouldn't work with un-trademarked oat bran as well!

Although the recipe calls for 'honey or molasses', I prefer to make
these muffins with blackstrap molasses. Takes some of the sweetness
out of them, and really blends well with the bran flavor. The muffins
are wonderfully dark and moist, and while raisins are good, these
things are unbeatable with blueberries :-)

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Line 12 medium muffin cups with paper baking
cups, or spray bottoms with Pam. Combine dry ingredients; mix well.
Add combined milk, egg whites and honey; mix just until dry
ingredients are moistened. Fill prepared muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake 15
to 17 minutes, or until golden brown.

Ingredients:
  3               Cups  100% Bran(r) cereal -- or All Bran
     1/2           Cup  applesauce
  1                Cup  raisins
  1                Cup  boiling water
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten, or
                        -- 1/2 c. Egg Beaters
  2               Cups  buttermilk
  6        Tablespoons  molasses -- and/ or honey
                        (3T of each works well

Instructions:

  2 1/4             C.  whole wheat flour
  2 1/2            Tsp  baking soda
     1/2           Tsp  salt

If you like dark muffins you might want to use all molasses; if
you use sweetened applesauce you probably should cut down some on the
molasses/honey)

I like them better after they have been frozen - they
get more dense & come out of the paper liners easier.  They might be
a little more work than some other recipes, but I have made them
many, many times & think they're worth it. [Linda]

1. In a large bowl combine cereal, applesauce, and raisins; pour
the boiling water over them.

2. In a small bowl combine eggs, buttermilk, honey and molasses.  Add
to the partly cooled cereal mixture.

3. In another small bowl combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to
the cereal mixture, stirring just enough to moisten dry ingredients,
Cover with plastic wrap & let stand at least 15 minutes, preferably 1
hour.

4. Fill 24 sprayed muffin cups (if you use paper liners, spray the
inside of the papers or the muffins will stick) Bake at 400 degrees
for 20-25 minutes.  Watch carefully so they don't get over-baked.

Ingredients:
  2               cups  dried black beans -- soaked in water
                        over night
  4               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3               cups  chopped onion
  10            medium  garlic cloves -- crushed

Instructions:

optional toppings: sour cream
                   cilantro
                   salsa

The orange juice and the cumin give a great taste to this soup. We
did it without toppings.


Recipe given to me by a Brazilian who said that she never heard of
that soup in Brazil. Brazil is a large country...

Yield 6 to 8 servings

1) Place the soaked beans in a pot with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil,
cover, and simmer until tender - about 1 1/4 hour.

2) Heat oil in a skillet. Add onion, half the garlic, cumin, salt and
carrot. Saute over medium heat until the carrot is just tender. Add
the rest of the garlic and the diced green pepper. Saute another 10 to
15 minutes.

3) Add the vegetables to the cooked beans (keep the black water),
stir in the orange juice,
add black and cayenne peppers.


4) To thicken the soup, puree some of it in a blender or food processor
and return it to the pot. Simmer over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes
more.

             Potatoes
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  3               pkgs  yeast -- (3 tbl) refreshed in
     1/2           cup  water -- and
  1                tbl  brown sugar -- (or 2 tbl white
                        sugar)
  4 1/4           cups  flour
     3/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  1                med  potato -- unpeeled, boiled in
                        -- 2 cups water
  1                cup  wheat germ
     1/2           cup  skim dry milk
  2                tsp  salt

Instructions:

The first time I made this I thought it was wonderful.  Later attempts did not
seem quite as moist nor did they rise as high.  I think you should not use
more than about 3/4 cup of WW flour.  This bread is alot of work, but very
tasty.

I regularly add one step that is nonstandard: I almost always give the bread
an extra rising when the flour is half mixed in.  The extra rising make the
bread smoother.  With sourdough the extra rising allows the starter to digest
many of the lumps of flour which makes the dough almost silky soft.  After
adding about 1/3 - 1/2 of the flour the dough is the texture of muffin, waffle
or brownie batter and I let it rise until doubled.  Some of the recipes (esp
the ones with potato) refer to this as a "slurry".  Some recipes, especially
those that use potato to enhance the yeast, do call for this extra rising;
however I add this step to all bread recipes. [Anne]
----

Proof the yeast until it gets a 2" head.  Add 1/2 cup flour and stir until
it's a smooth paste.  Set this sponge aside to rise for about an hour.  Each
time it doubles in bulk, stir it down.

Boil potato until it is done.  Place it in a potato ricer.  SAVE the water!
Push the potato through the ricer until you have a very smooth mashed potato.
Measure 1 1/2 cups potato water (add tap water if you have to).  Add the
mashed potato to the water and set aside to cool.


Combine whole wheat flour, 1 cup regular flour, wheat germ, dried milk and
salt.  Stir well.  When potato mixture has cooled and yeast mixture has been
deflated at least two times, add both to the flour mixture.  Stir until all
ingredients are well blended.  Add up to another 1 cup of flour until mixture
is a slurry the consistency of brownie mixture.  Cover and set aside to rise.

Add the rest of the flour and knead the bread.  Let rise about 1-2 hours until
doubled in bulk.  Divide in two and form into loaves.  Place in greased loaf
pans and let rise again.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Immediately reduce
heat to 400 degrees when you put the bread into the oven.  Bake for 40
minutes.


* In addition to the cinnamon, add one or more of: nutmeg, cloves,
  ginger, vanilla

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1              quart  skim milk
  1              pound  bread -- cut into pieces
  4              whole  egg substitute
     3/4           cup  sugar -- brown or white
                        (up to 1 cup sugar)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla -- up to 2T
                        cinnamon -- optional
                        raisins -- optional

Instructions:

Break up or cut up a loaf of bread (about 1 pound).  I leave the crusts on.
Sometimes I mix white bread and whole wheat.  The better (ie, more like
homemade) the bread is, the better the pudding will be.  Stale bread
works fine.  In fact, when I have some bread that's getting stale, I toss
it in the freezer before it gets moldy, and when I've collected about a
loaf's worth, I thaw it out and make bread pudding.

I use skim milk, about a quart.  I pour it over the bread and let it sit
for awhile while the bread soaks it up.  I use egg substitute instead of
eggs (equivalent of 4 eggs), and I can't tell the difference.  Either
brown or white sugar is fine.  I use between 3/4 and 1 cup.  I've cut
down the sugar from my original recipe quite a bit--I think it called for
2 cups.  If you're going to serve it with a sauce, you need less sugar
than if you'll be eating it plain.  I like lots of vanilla in my bread
pudding--I use 1 to 2 tablespoons.  I sometimes add a little cinnamon.  And
raisins, either brown or golden.

I don't use any butter.  My original recipe called for it, but I've been
leaving it out for quite some time.  I spray a 9 by 13 inch glass pan
with butter-flavored cooking spray before I pour in the pudding.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for about 50 minutes until firm.  Serve warm or cold.

Now for my question:  I adore bread pudding with New Orleans Whiskey
Sauce.  NOWS is made with butter, eggs, sugar and bourbon.  I can't
figure out any way to defat this.  :-(  I know that bread pudding is
good by itself. (In fact, plain cold bread pudding is one of my
favorite breakfasts.)  But I've come to love it with sauce for
dessert.

Ingredients:
     1/2           Cup  sugar
                        bread cubes to half fill 4 quart casserole
  2          Teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2           Cup  raisins
  2               Cups  skim milk
  2              Whole  egg whites

Instructions:

Someone asked about bread pudding.  Bread pudding is one of those
things that you just sort of throw together so I don't have a real
accurate recipe for it but I'll try and give approximate amounts.

I usually save bread ends and stale bread in the freezer until
I'm ready to make the bread pudding.  I like to use whole wheat
bread with maybe a little white mixed in because it doesn't get
real mushy.  Anyway, get a four quart ovenproof casserole dish
and cut the bread into about half inch cubes.  Use enough bread
to fill the casserole dish a little over half full.  Add in
1/2 cup sugar, about 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and about 1/2 cup
raisens and sort of toss it all together.  Add 1 egg (or 2 egg
whites) and about 2 cups milk and stir it all up.

Sometimes you have to add more milk if the bread is real dry or you have a lot
of whole wheat bread in it.  I usually sort of smash the bread down
in the casserole dish and if the milk comes up near the top I've
got enough.

Stir up the bread again though cause you don't want
it smashed down hard, then smooth it out so it's nice and even
on top.  Bake at 350 degrees F. maybe 1/2 hour or until the top
is nice and brown and the center isn't real wet.  As I said, it's
not real accurate but it tastes good.  You can also replace the
raisens with chopped apple or use both and you might want to vary
the amount of sugar depending on how sweet you want it.

Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 4, 180 C (350 F).  Grease a 2-2 1/2 pint
baking dish (1.25-1.5 litre)

Break the bread into suitable-sized pieces and place them in a bowl.
Pour over the milk, then give the mixture a good stir and leave for
about 30 minutes so that the bread becomes well soaked with the milk.

Now add the melted butter [if using!], sugar, mixed spice and beaten
egg [whites].  Using a fork, beat the mixture well, making sure that no
lumps remain, then stir in the mixed fruit and orange rind.  Spread in
the baking dish, sprinkle with nutmeg, and bake for about 1 1/4 hours.

Delicious hot or cold!  At least, the regular version is - I must experiment
with defatting this, as I adore bread pudding!

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  4               cups  French bread -- day old, cubed
     1/4           cup  pecans -- in pieces
  2              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  packed dark brown sugar -- + 2 T.
  2               cups  evaporated skim milk
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  nutmeg -- grated
     1/2           cup  raisins
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        BOURBON SAUCE:
     1/3           cup  evaporated milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  bourbon
  2        tablespoons  nonfat plain yogurt

Instructions:

Here's a lowered fat version of bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  I'm also
including a a sauce recipe I use with gingerbread.  It does have a
tablespoon of butter, but I think low- or non-fat margarine would work (as
is, the CFF% is not bad). [Ann]

Nothing is wasted in a Cajun kitchen where stale bread becomes a luscious
dessert.
To make Bread Pudding: Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Spread bread cubes on a baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes, stirring
twice, or until lightly toasted.
Meanwhile, spread pecans in a pie plate and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or
until fragrant. Let cool and chop coarsely.
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and brown sugar. Blend in evaporated
skim milk, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir in the toasted French bread,
pecans and raisins. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to
1 hour.
Meanwhile, lightly coat a shallow 2-qt. baking dish with vegetable oil or
nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with 1/2 Tbsp. of the sugar. In a small
saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Skim off froth and cook until it begins
to turn light nutty brown, 1-1/2 to 2 minutes. (Be careful not to burn the
butter.) Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.
Pour the bread mixture over the top and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 Tbsp
. sugar. Bake the pudding for 40 minutes, or until firm in the center.
Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees and bake for 10 to 15 minutes
longer, or until the top is browned and puffed.
To make Bourbon Sauce:  Meanwhile, place a deep mixing bowl, beaters and
evaporated skim milk in the freezer to chill for 20 minutes. In the chilled
bowl, using an electric mixer, beat evaporated skim milk for 1 to 2 minutes
or until it is the consistency of whipped cream.
Gradually add sugar, bourbon and yogurt and beat for several minutes longer,
or until thickened. Serve over warm bread pudding. Serves 8.

             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2               Cups  bread flour
  1 1/2           Cups  whole-wheat flour
  1           Teaspoon  sugar
  2        Tablespoons  firmly packed brown sugar
  1           Teaspoon  salt
     1/2      Teaspoon  ground ginger
  2        Tablespoons  butter -- chilled and cut
                        into pieces
  1         Tablespoon  active dry yeast -- (I use rapid-rise)
  1                Cup  water -- lukewarm
  3        Tablespoons  water -- lukewarm

Instructions:

Yield:  2 standard-sized loaves (using loaf pans)

Insert metal blade in work bowl of food processor.  Add flours, sugars,
salt, ginger, and butter; process for approx. 20 seconds.  Add yeast and
process for approximately 10 seconds more to fully mix the ingredients.

Add water; process until dough forms a ball in the work bowl.  Insert dough
blade and continue processing for approximately 2 minutes.  Remove dough to
greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap.

Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down.  Repeat.

Punch down dough; divide into two equal-sized pieces.  Form into loaves and
place in lightly greased (I use Pam cooking spray) loaf pans.  Cover loosely
with tea towel or plastic wrap; place in warm, draft-free location until
dough reaches the top of the loaf pans.

Preheat oven to 375F.  Uncover loaves and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove
loaves from pans and place back into oven, baking for 10 more minutes.
Remove to cooling racks and cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing.  If
freezing loaves for later use, cool thoroughly (about 90 minutes).

This recipe yields an extremely fluffy, airy loaf with a very pleasant
texture which is perfect for making toast and sandwiches.

NOTE:  I have doubled this recipe when using my KitchenAid with excellent
results.

                        ****

Instructions:

 I like potato & bean
(oven baked hash browns & refried pinto or black beans).  Sometimes I make
them with scrambled egg whites & potatoes.  Other good fillings are non-fat
cheese, tky canadian bacon, and tomatoes.  Generally you use the flour
tortilla, but if you can't find a low fat one (look out for lard!), use the
corn ones.  And if you can't deal with those, shove it all in a pita pocket.
The beauty of breakfast tacos is to set up an assembly line one Saturday
afternoon with your various ingrediants.  Put together a couple of dozen &
freeze them.  (Hint: heat tortillas directly on gas burner to make them easy
to handle)

Instructions:

Use fat-free (if not available, use lard-free) flour
tortillas.  Warm the tortilla directly on your gas burner, flipping with tongs
(warm in low oven with damp towel over the pan if burner not available).  Put
in your favorite fillings:

low-fat/fat-free refried beans
potatoes:  peeled, boiled, & cubed
rice:  made with tomato sauce & chili powder
egg whites:  scrambled & pre-cooked
jalepneos:  yes!  for breakfast!
low-fat/fat-free cheese (be sure & put on HOT tortilla with something else HOT
on top; roll quickly!

Some might think beans & jalepenos are weird for breakfast, but if you've been
out on the town the night before, they are a life saver.  I make them on
Sunday nights, freeze them & take them to work for brakfast all week.

Ingredients:
  12                    lasagna noodles
  1              bunch  broccoli -- bite size pieces **
                        (about 4 cups)
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  nonfat cottage cheese -- (12 oz)
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
                        or substitute
  1                jar  spaghetti sauce -- (16 oz)
                        or homemade sauce
     1/2           cup  water
  2               cups  mozzarella cheese -- shredded, (8 oz)
                        (I used part skim)

Instructions:

(serves 6)
1. Cook noodles in boiling water. Drain and rinse in cold water.
 Set aside.

2. Combine broccoli and onion in a 2 quart microwave safe measure.
 Cover with plastic wrap.

3. Microwave (high) 10-12 minutes or until tender-crisp. Drain.
 Mix in cottage cheese and egg.

4. Spoon 1 cup spaghetti sauce into a 12x8" microwave safe baking
 pan. Layer 6 noodles on sauce. Spoon on all the cottage
 cheese mixture, spreading evenly. Sprinkle with 1 cup
 mozzarella cheese. Layer remaining noodles. Spoon re-
 maining spaghetti sauce evenly over noodles. Cover with
 waxed paper.

5. Microwave (high) 14-16 minutes or until heat through (140 degrees),
 rotating dish once or twice. Sprinkle lasagna with remaining
 cheese.

6. Microwave (high), uncovered, 2-3 minutes or until cheese is melted.
 Let stand 5-10 minutes before cutting into squares for serving.

**Two 10-oz packages of frozen chopped broccoli can be substituted
for fresh. Microwave as directed in Step 3.

My notes show that this contains 7.5 grams of fat per serving. That's
assuming a whole egg and part-skim cheese. Not too shabby. You could
make it even better with non-fat mozzarella but I've never tried it.
Non-fat mozzarella wasn't around when I last tried this recipe. If you
use the non-fat, don't put the cheese on top. Cover it with some of the
sauce which will make it melt better.

Ingredients:
  2            bunches  broccoli
  1                tbl  olive oil
     1/4           cup  water
  4             cloves  garlic
                        salt to taste

Instructions:

Cut up the broccoli into florets. Peel the tough stems and cut them up
into small pieces.

Put the broccoli in a saucepan with the water, oil, garlic and salt.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 5 minutes until the
broccoli is just cooked and bright green. Turn up the heat and cook until
the water evaporates, a couple of minutes.

Sprinkle with red pepper flakes, if desired.

This is quite low in fat and very tasty. Of course, I love broccoli and I
love garlic.

             Soups & Stews

Ingredients:
  2               cups  water
  1 1/2         pounds  broccoli -- stalks separated
     3/4           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  chicken bouillon
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  evaporated skim milk

Instructions:

You can also make Cauliflower Soup by substituting 2 lbs
cauliflower for the Broccoli.

1. Heat the 2 C water in a large pot until boiling.

2. Add vegetables, cover and cook until tender (about 10 mins).

3. Blend vegetables with part of the cooking water in a blender
or food processor.

4. Heat olive oil in a small nonstick skillet.  Add 2 Tb of the
2 1/2 C water and sprinkle in the flour. Cook and stir until smooth.

5. Add the remaining water and heat to boiling, stirring constantly.
Boil and stir 1 minute. (I think they mean to do this in the large pot).

6. Stir in broccoli mixture, instant bouillon, salt, pepper, and
nutmeg.  Heat just until boiling.

7. Stir in the evaporated skim milk and heat through without boiling
    again.

Makes about 9 Cups.

  1                 Lb  Broccoli

Instructions:

I made this last week. I thought it was great, but Josey thought the combination of mushrooms and broccoli wasn't ideal. Then again she complains if I put mushrooms in anything.-)  The cashews could be replaced with some soya milk or tofu if you're trying to keep the fat down.

Fry the onion and the garlic in some water until tender. Add the mushrooms, the vegetable stock, the salt, pepper and sage.  Leave simmering until the mushrooms have reduced.
In a blender combine the chopped broccoli stalks, the kidney beans, the chopped leeks, and the cashews. Blend until smooth, adding water if needed.

Add the blended mixture to the mushrooms. Add the broccoli florets and any additional water needed to give a creamy consistency. Simmer till the florets have softened.

Serve over pasta twirls. On this occasion I used Orgran's Barley and Spinach (wheat free) pasta.

asparagus and roll them around to cover. Place the asparagus on a rack
over a pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil them until they start to
brown. Turn and brown on the other side. You have to be careful since
they can cook really fast under the broiler and you don't want to
incinerate them.

Ingredients:
  4                     Swordfish Steaks -- -- 6 - 8 oz ea
                        (cut 1" thick)
  4               Tbsp  Olive Oil
                        Salt And Pepper -- to taste
     1/4             C  Fresh Lemon Juice
  1                 Cl  Garlic -- pressed
  1 1/2           Tbsp  Capers -- drained
     1/2           Tsp  Lemon Zest -- finely grated
  1               Tbsp  Parsley -- chopped

Instructions:

The greatest danger when cooking swordfish is drying it out.  A light brush with oil is a nice way to retain moisture.  Once the fish is out from the broiler, it will cook for a min or two, so bear this in mind when testing it.

1.  Preheat the broiler.  Brush the fish lightly on both sides with 1 T olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Ingredients:
  3                 tb  cilantro -- minced
  3                 tb  Fish sauce
  3                 tb  low sodium soy sauce
  2                 tb  Fresh lime juice
  1                 tb  Freshly ground black pepper
  1                 tb  Minced garlic -- (3 cloves)
  2             pounds  chicken thighs -- or breasts
                        -- skin and fat removed

Instructions:

  A street and market food served everywhere in Thailand, this chicken
  is traditionally associated with the Northeast. At the train stations
  or bus stop, you can get a few skewers and a little bag of sticky
  rice for a delicious snack or light lunch. The marinade dates back to
  a time before the introduction of chilies by the Portuguese. Black
  peppercorns were used in enormous quantities, and they still have an
  important role in Thai cooking.

  Combine cilantro root, fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, pepper and
  garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth and pour
  into a shallow, non aluminum dish. Add chicken and turn to coat
  evenly with marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at
  least 1 hour or up to 8 hours, turning occasionally.

  Preheat the broiler or prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Drain the
  chicken and reserve the marinade for basting. Broil or grill the
  chicken on a lightly oiled rack approximately 3 inches from the heat
  for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken and baste with the reserved
  marinade. Discard any leftover marinade. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes
  longer, or until the outside is browned and the inside is no longer
  pink.

Ingredients:
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  3             slices  fresh ginger -- minced (3 to 4)
  2              small  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chives -- snipped
  2             medium  nectarines -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  apricot preserves
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  4             medium  carrots -- cut into 1-inch
                        chunks
  1 1/4         pounds  sea scallops
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cut into 1-inch
                        squares
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish
                        (optional)

Instructions:

It said to serve it with brown rice pilaf studded with almonds and
chopped apricots.  (Almonds will add fat of course).

(Serves 4)

1. In a small saucepan, warm 2 teaspoons of the oil over medium-high heat until
   hot but not smoking. Add the ginger and garlic, and stir-fry until fragrant,
   about 30 seconds.

2. Add the minced chives, chopped nectarines, apricot preserves, mustard,
   vinegar and black pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce the heat to low,
   cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.

3. Meanwhile, cook the carrots in a medium saucepan of boiling water until
   almost tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly.

4. Preheat the broiler. Cut any large scallops so that all of the scallops are
   approximately the same size. Divide the carrots, scallops, and bell pepper
   evenly among 8 skewers and place them on a nonstick broiler pan.

5. Transfer half of the nectarine mixture to a food processor or blender and
   puree until smooth.

6. Brush the skewers with half of the nectarine puree, and drizzle with 1
   teaspoon of the remaining oil. Broil the scallops 4 inches from the heat for
   3 minutes.

7. Turn the skewers over, brush them with the remaining pur e and drizzle with
   the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Broil until cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.

8. Serve the scallops with the reserved nectarine sauce on the side. Garnish
   with chopped chives, if desired.

Ingredients:
                        tomatoes -- halved
                        Italian bread crumbs
                        nonfat cheddar cheese -- sliced
                        -- or- any nonfat cheese of your choice
                        olive oil spray

Instructions:

I have found that most FF cheeses will melt and become bubbly if you
mist them (or brush lightly, whatever method) with olive oil.  I
frequently make broiled tomatoes by slicing them in half, sprinkling
with italian flavored bread crumbs, and placing a slice of Weight
Watchers or Healthy Choice Fat Free Sharp Cheddar on top.  Mist with
oil, and broil for 5ish minutes.  Wonderful results and a very nice
dinner when you add a mixed greens salad with balsamic vinegar.

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- unbleached(see note)
     1/2             c  vital wheat gluten
  1 1/2              t  salt
                        ***
     1/4             c  warm water
  1                pkt  active dry yeast -- (or 1 scant T)
                        ***
  1                  c  hot water
  1                  T  barley malt extract -- (liquid)
                        ***
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- (1/2 to 1)(see note)
                        unbleached
                        ***
  2                 qt  water
  3                  T  barley malt extract

Instructions:

In a large bowl, mix together the first three ingredients.

Then soften the yeast in a small bowl  with 1/4c water.

Dissolve malt extract in 1 cup hot water.

Let malt mixture cool down to warm.  Make a well in the center of
the flour mixture.  Pour into the well, in this order:  Softened
yeast mixture, malt water.

Stir together until smooth.  Beat this dough vigorously to develop
the gluten.  To make a very stiff dough, gradually add the flour.


Turn out on a floured surface and knead for a full 10 minutes.
Divide dough into 12 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into a ball.
Cover balls of dough with a cloth and work with one at a time.
Place the ball on a very lightly floured surface. Flatten slightly.
Poke the center of the ball with a forefinger, going all the way
through.  Now use the fingers of both hands to gently open up the
ring.  Try to keep the doughnut-shaped roll you are forming
symmetrical.  The hole should be about one-third of the bagel's
diameter.  Place shaped rings on a non-stick baking sheet.  Cover
and let rise for 15 to 20 minutes.  They should not quite double
in size.  Meanwhile, ready the boiling liquid.  In a large pot,
heat the water.

Stir the malt barley into water.

Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and keep regulated to a healthy
simmer.  Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.  One at a time, slip risen
bagels into simmering water.  Bagels should float.  If they sink,
do not worry.  They will soon rise to the surface.  After about
30 seconds, turn them over.  They should remain in the water about
1 minute in all.  You may simmer several at a time, but do not
crowd them in the pot.  Remove with a skimmer and place one inch
apart on a non-stick baking sheet.  Brush bagels with a mixture
of 1 egg and 1 T water.  If desired, sprinkle with coarse salt or
poppy seeds.

Bake at 475 degrees F. for 10 to 12 minutes, or until well-browned.
Cool slightly on wire racks.  Serve warm.

Note:  In place of unbleached white flour, equal parts of
       stone-ground rye flour, stone-ground whole-wheat flour,
       and unbleached all-purpose flour may be used.

Here's a bagel recipe I like.  You can make it either with white flour
or with a mixture of 1/3 white flour, 1/3 whole wheat flour, and 1/3
rye flour.  Barley malt extract is very important for the flavor of the
bagels.  Places that sell supplies for home brewers sell barley malt
extract by the pound.  Bring your own container.  I use an empty juice
bottle. [Nadia]

Basic Bread Setting

Process the ingredients according to your manufacturer's instructions for
a basic bread setting.  This recipe was developed using just-cooked rice.
If your rice has been sitting in the refrigerator overnight, you may need
an extra tablespoon or so of water.  If your machine has a light crust
setting, you might want to try it.

Remove the bread from the bread machine pan to a rack to cool.  Wrap to
store in aluminum foil or ina clean, brown paper bag.

This is WONDERFUL!!

into 4 equal portions.  Knead each piece, cover & let rest 10 - 15
minutes.  Butter four 8 1/2" loaf pans.  Form the dough into
loaves & place in the pans. Cover & let rise until just curved
over tops of pans, about 30 -40 minutes.  Brush the loaves with the
glaze & sprinkle with seeds or wheat germ.

Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Let cool on wire racks.

Ingredients:
  4               cups  cooked brown rice -- (I used Uncle Ben's)
  1                cup  zucchini -- chopped
  1                cup  carrots -- chopped
     1/4           cup  purple onions -- chopped

  1         tablespoon  fresh basil -- chopped

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                tsp  thyme
  2                tsp  parsley

     1/2           tsp  salt
                        fresh ground pepper to taste

Instructions:

Mix the dressing ingredients first, and then add to the salad. Toss to mix.
Best served chilled, but was actually pretty good warm.  Very colorful, and
would probably make a great main dish for folks who limit their meat intake.
Makes about 8-10 servings (side dish), so my estimate is about 2 grams or so
per serving.  Since I made the whole thing in a food processor, it was
extremely easy.

  Preheat oven to 350 F. Combine cooked rice and the egg white and mix well.
Spray a 9 inch pie pan with non-stick vegetable spray. Spread the rice
mixture evenly over bottom and sides of pan, pressing lightly with
fingertips or the back of a spoon to shape into a crust. Bake, uncovered,
in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Fill as desired. Makes 8 pie-crust

Instructions:

[A long history of family get-togethers where food, especially chocolate
desserts, was the big attraction inspired Bonnie Feise's winning recipe.
Sweet, moist and seemingly rich, Granny's Chocolate Marvel Cake is
virtually fat-free.  This clever recipe is a good road map to low-fat
baking.  part of its moisture comes from pureed prunes -- which like
applesauce, apricot and other fruit purees, can successfully substitute
for oil, margarine or butter in some recipes.  Its deep color comes from
cocoa powder and coffee instead of fat-rich chocolate.]

Into large mixing bowl sift together flour, cocoa, sugar, baking
soda, baking powder and salt.  In medium bowl stir together milk,
prunes, vanilla, egg whites or egg substitute and cappuccino or
coffee.  Pour moist ingredients into dry, blending well.  Spray two
9-inch round baking pans with nonstick spray.  Divide batter equally
between pans.  Bake in preheated 350 degree F oven 30-35 minutes or
until center tests done with wooden pick.  Let cakes cool in pans
10 minutes.  Invert onto wire rack; cool.

(My jar of cream of tartar says that

so you possibly could make this substitution if you can't find cream of
tartar.  I haven't tried it though.)

                        salt and pepper
                        bay leaf

Instructions:

put all the ingredients in a heavy skillet or shallow pot
(enamelized cast-iron is perfect).  pour about 2 cups vegetable
stock or broth over the vegetables, and add salt and cracked
black pepper to taste, and a bayleaf if you have one.  cook on
highish heat until liquid boils, then reduce heat to medium-low
and cook, covered, until the vegetables are falling-apart tender
and the broth is caramelizing on the bottom of the pan (maybe 30
minutes--tend to it occasionally, adding broth if neccessary).
this is a simple, easy dinner that tastes great!  love those
brussels sprouts!  Oh, btw, you can do this in the pressure
cooker.  Keep under pressure for 5 minutes, and be sure to cut
the potatoes and carrots very small when using the pressure
cooker so that everything is cooked at the same time.  The
potatoes get a fabulous texture under pressure, but the broth
does not caramelize with the vegetable sugars.  Both ways have
their charms.

water with a fork. Add more water, if necessary, until the dough is sticky
but not damp. Knead for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth. You can use this dough
immediately since buckwheat has no gluten and, therefore, won't spring back

  1                Tsp  Sesame Seeds -- toasted

Instructions:

Buckwheat Noodles with Shiitake Mushrooms,
    Bok Choy, Ginger, and Scallions

adaped from Annie Sommerfield's _Fields_of_Greens_
[I *highly* recommend this cookbook, although it is
 decidedly on the gourmet side with high prep times]

2 T light vegetable oil or peanut oil [omitted; see NOTE at end]
Set a large pot of water on the stove to boil. Remove the mushroom
stems and cut the caps into 1/2-inch slices. (The stems can be saved
for stock.) For small heads of bok choy, slice the stem lengthwise,
leaving leaf and stem together. For a large head, slice the stems
diagonally, 3/4 inch thick, and slice the leaves into 2-inch-wide
ribbons.

When the water boils, add 1 teaspoon salt. Add the noodles and
cook as directed on the package, about 8 to 10 minutes. While
the pasta is cooking, heat the vegetable oil [see NOTE below]
in a large saute' pan; add the shiitake mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon
salt. Saute' over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, then add the
garlic, ginger, chilies [sic], and bok choy and saute' for 2
minutes.

Drain pasta in a colander when it is just tender [8 minutes worked
fine for me]. Reduce the heat under the saute' pan and add the
scallion, sesame oil, mirin, and soy sauce. Quickly add the
noodles, taking care not to overcook the bok choy. Remove from the
heat, toss the noodles with the vegetables and cilantro, and
season with salt to taste. Sprinkle with the sesame seed.

                        chopped
  2             medium  tomatoes -- peeled and chopped
  6                 oz  chickpeas -- (180g) cooked and
                        drained
  2                tbs  parsley -- finely chopped
  1                cup  bulgur -- (5 1/2 oz/115g)
                        -- medium or coarse grained
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- optional
                        Freshly ground black pepper
  1                cup  water

Instructions:

Microwave onion (or saute in a little water) until soft, add tomato and
continue cooking (again, either microwaving or on stove-top) until tomatoes
are paste-like.  Transfer to a saucepan (if you have microwaved thus far) and
add the chick peas, 1/2 tsp salt, and parsley.  Cook for about 10 minutes
on a lowish heat, stirring gently as you do so.  Now put in the bulghur
wheat, the water, and 3/4 tsp salt (unless you don't eat that much
salt, which I don't!).  Stir and bring to a simmer.  Cover, turn heat to
very low and cook for 35 minutes.  Turn off the flame.  Remove the lid and
quickly cover the pot with a tea towel.  Put the lid back on over the
tea towel.  Let the pot sit in a warm place for 20 minutes.  Put in the
black pepper and stir the wheat gently.

Notes:
~~~~~
I used far less salt than the recipe stated!

I added the black pepper before the cooking for 35 minutes, as I knew
I would forget, else.

For a variety of reasons, mainly that we were out, this sat very happily
for 5 hours in my kitchen, and reheated well in the microwave.

The family voted this simply delicious, but they were VERY hungry.

I think another time I would use cilantro instead of parsley.

I served with a green salad - Jaffrey says this quantity would feed
4-6 people, but either they have tiny appetites, or she means as part of
a larger meal, as it was just a nice amount for the three of us.

Recipe:      Buttermilk Biscuits

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- (White Lily)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- [the real secret]
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  3        tablespoons  butter -- or margarine or
                        -- vegetable shortening

Instructions:

Sift dry ingredients into a bowl.  Cut shortening into dry ingredients
until it resembles cornmeal.  (or a least close to it ;) )  I use my
fingers, that's the way my mom always did it.

Add the buttermilk.  Stir until smooth.  The dough will be very moist.
Don't despair, it's suppose to look like that.

Now, add a few (2 or 3) tablespoons of flour onto a board.  Dip the
dough into heaping tablespoons. Drop into the pile of flour.  Put just enough
flour onto your hands to keep the dough from sticking.  Add only enough
flour to the biscuit to enable it to be scooped from the board and
handled.  (I hoped that made sense.) Pat the piece of dough into a
biscuit.  DO NOT add more flour than necessary to handle the dough
without sticking.  It's suppose to be that soft. Place in a pan that has
been sprayed with Pam or whatever brand you may use.  I usually use a 9"
cake pan I have reserved just for biscuits.  The recipe usually makes 9
biscuits.  Now for the real heart-stopping (no pun intended) action, I
brush the tops with melted butter before and after baking.  I think I
have the oven at 425, pre-heated of course, and bake until
golden-brown...around 12 minutes.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2          Teaspoons  active dry yeast
                        (1 pkg, do NOT use rapid riseor fast rise)
     1/2           Cup  warm water -- (105-110F)
  5 1/2           Cups  whole wheat flour
                        -- or- 5 cups WW and 1/2 cup rye flour
  2          Teaspoons  salt
     3/4           Cup  hot water
                        -- or-2 c warm water -- (110F)
  1 1/4           Cups  buttermilk -- cold
                        -- or- 5 Tbsp powdered buttermilk
     1/4           Cup  honey
  2               Tbsp  butter -- (2 to 4)
                        or 2-3 tsp margarine

Instructions:

I knead by hand (not having anything other way to do it), but it should
work with a machine if you're careful not to overknead it.  This is from
 _The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book_, which I would HIGHLY recommend to
anyone who bakes bread.  I make only a couple of modifications to the
recipe which I will put in braces ([]).  It also makes wonderful rolls.

Dissolve yeast in 1/2 c warm water and let stand a few minutes to proof.
(It will get a little foamy on top.)  Mix flour and salt in a large mixing
bowl [I add powdered buttermilk here].  Make a well in the middle.  Mix
hot water, buttermilk and honey [I use the 2 cups warm water].  Mixture
should be slightly warm.  Pour into well in flour with the yeast mixture
and stir from the center out, gradually incorporating the flour into the
liquids.  Dough will be soft, but should not be soggy. (Check by squeezing
a bit of the dough between your fingers.  If it is too wet, add a bit more
flour and mix again.  [The last few times I've made this, I've had to add
almost 1/2 cup more flour.])  Turn out onto floured working surface and
knead about 20 minutes, adding more flour as needed to keep dough from
sticking.  Don't add too much, since you do not want the dough to get
stiff.  After about 15 minutes of kneading, knead in the butter in small
pieces.  [I can really tell a difference in the texture of the dough after
I've done this.]  Rinse a clean bowl out with warm water (to warm the
bowl) and put dough in bowl.  Cover with a clean, damp towel and put in a
warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.  To check when it has risen
enough, wet one finger and press it into the dough about 1/2 inch.  If the
depression remains, or if dough sighs a little around the edges, it has
risen enough.  If the depression fills in a bit, let dough rise a little
longer.  When it has risen, gently deflate dough in bowl, round it, cover
with damp cloth and let rise in warm place until it has risen again, about
45 min.  (Check as before).  Turn out dough onto lightly floured working
surface and flatten with your hands to about 1 inch thickness, working any
large air bubbles out to the edges.  Divide dough in half and form each
half into a ball.  (Fold over one edge a little more than halfway, pressing
slightly to seal and press out air bubbles, turn dough, and repeat until
dough is rounded [this is harder to explain than to do :-)].  Cover and
let rest 10 minutes.  Lightly grease 2 bread pans (8x4 inch pans).  Shape
dough into loaves, place in pans, cover with damp cloth and let rise in
warm place about 30 min.  Preheat oven to 350F.  Place pans (uncovered) in
oven on middle rack and bake about 40-50 min, until browned on top and
loaf tests done.  (Turn loaf out of pan and thump lightly on bottom.  If it
sounds hollow, loaf is done.)  Remove from pans and cool on wire rack.
Brush tops of loaves with melted butter if desired.

To make rolls, substitute 1-2 cups whole wheat flour with whole wheat
pastry flour (to make them lighter).  After dividing dough and letting it
rest, divide each half into thirds, and each third into fifths.  Round
each piece and put into 2 lightly greased 9x13 inch pans (3 rows of 5 in
each pan).  Let rise about 30 min, and bake at 350F for 20-30 min. Brush
tops with melted butter if desired.

[My notes:  powdered buttermilk can be found with the powdered milk in the
grocery store, in a small round can (Saco brand, I think).  According to
the label, when it is reconstituted with water, it has 0.7 g fat per cup.
The two risings will make the loaves lighter and rise higher than a single
rising will.  Rapid rise yeast doesn't have the staying power for this,
though, so you need to use regular yeast.  I have also used molasses in
place of honey, so if you like the flavor, go ahead.  I hope the
directions are clear enough for novices.  It's hard to describe without
pictures.  If they're not clear enough, see if your library has the book.
I usually freeze the second loaf.  They keep unfrozen at least a week
without any appreciable drying out.  (They may keep longer if you hide
them! :-) )]

Ingredients:
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- or vegetable stock
  1                cup  apple juice
  1             medium  butternut squash -- peeled and cubed
  1              whole  onion -- peeled and chopped
  1              whole  apple -- peeled and chopped
  1           teaspoon  oil -- optional
  1           teaspoon  curry powder

Instructions:

Saute onion in oil or a teaspoon of stock, together with curry
powder until soft.  Add rest of ingredients.  Bring to boil, then
reduce heat & simmer until butternut is cooked.  Puree or mash up
butternut until smooth.  Serve with fresh crusty bread.

As the butternut is pureed, the soup will thicken - add more
stock/apple juice to thin it out a bit if you wish.
This soup freezes great - might need to thin it out with some
stock/juice.

I have also tried this recipe with by substituting the butternut with
broccoli & celery - also good but next time I would decrease the
apple juice to 0.5 cup and increase the stock to 3 cups.

until it just looses its firmness and drain. Meanwhile saute, in a large
skillet, the carrots and onions in broth until onions are just translucent
and the carrots are crisp tender. Add the squash and orange juice mixture
to the carrots and onions. Continue cooking until the squash has the
desired
texture and the moisture has boiled off.

Prep Time:   2:26
Categories:  Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Soups & Stews
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  6              large  green onion -- or 1 large onion
  5                     beef bouillon cube -- up to 8
  2                     green peppers
  1                can  baby lima beans
  1              large  canned tomatoes -- (1 to 2)
  1                can  green beans -- french cut
  1              bunch  celery
                        garlic
  1               head  cabbage -- large
  1            package  onion soup mix -- (Lipton's)

Instructions:

Cut vegetables into small to medium pieces and cover with water.  Boil for
ten minutes.  Reduce to simmer and continue cooking until vegetables are
tender.  This soup can be eaten anytime you are hungry.  Eat as much as you
want, whenever you want, at any time of the day.  This soup will not add
calories; the more you eat, the more you lose.  If eaten alone for
indefinite periods, you would suffer malnutrition.  Fill a thermos in the
morning if you will be away for the day.

DAY ONE
All fruit except bananas.  Your first day will consist of all the fruit you
want except bananas.  Cantaloupes and watermelon are lower calories than
most fruits.  Eat only our soup and fruits the first day.  For drinks -
unsweetened tea, cranberry juice or water.

DAY TWO
All vegetables of your choice.  Try to eat green leafy veggies and stay
away from dry beans, peas and corn.  Eat all the vegetables you want along
with your soup.  At dinner time on this day reward yourself with a big
baked potato with butter.  Eat all the soup you want this day, but NO
fruit.

DAY THREE
Mix day one and day two.  Eat all the soup, fruits, veggies you want.  You
CANNOT have a baked potato this day.

If you have eaten for three days as above, and have not cheated, you will
have lost 5 to 7 pounds.

DAY FOUR
Bananas and skimmed milk.  Eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many
glasses of skimmed milk as you can on this day, along with your soup.
Bananas are high in calories and carbohydrates and so is the milk, but on
this particular day of your diet your body will need the potassium and the
carbohydrates, proteins, and calcium to lessen your craving for sweets.

DAY FIVE
Beef and tomatoes.  You may have 10 -20 oz of beef and a can of tomatoes or
as many as 6 fresh tomatoes on this day.  Try to drink at least 6 - 8
glasses of water this day to wash away the uric acid in your body.  Eat
your soup at east once this day.

DAY SIX
Beef and veggies.  Eat to your heart's content of beef and vegetables this
day.  You can even have two or three steaks if you like with green leafy
vegetables,  BUT NO BAKED POTATO.  Be sure to eat your soup at least once
this day.

DAY SEVEN
Brown rice, unsweetened fruit juices and vegetables.  Again, stuff, stuff,
stuff yourself.  Be sure to eat your soup at least once.

At the end of the seventh day, if you have not cheated on this diet, you
will find that you have lost 10 - 17 pounds.  If you have lost more than 15
pounds, stay off the diet for two days before resuming the diet again for
day one.

This seven day eating plan can be used as often as you like.  As a matter
of fact, if correctly followed, it will clean your system of impurities and
give you a feeling of well-being as never before.

After only days of this process, you will begin to feel lighter by at least
10 possibly 17 pounds, and have an abundance of energy.  Continue this plan
as long as you wish and feel the difference.

This diet is a fast, fat-burning diet and the secret is that you will burn
more calories than you take in.  It will flush your system of impurities
and give you a feeling of well-being.  This diet does not lead itself to
drinking any alcoholic beverage at any time because of the removal of fat
build-up in your system.  Go off the diet at least 24 hours before any
intake of alcohol.

Because everyone's digestive system is different, this diet will affect
everyone differently.  After day three, you will have more energy than when
you began if you do not cheat.  After being on the diet for several days,
you will find your bowel movement has changed - eat a cup of bran and
fiber.  Although you can have black coffee with this diet you may find that
you don't need the caffeine after the third day.

DEFINITE NO-NOs:  No bread, no alcoholic beverages, no carbonated
beverages, not even Tab or other diet drinks.  Stick with water,
unsweetened tea, black coffee, unsweetened fruit juices, cranberry juice
and skimmed milk on the day it is allowed.

The Basic Fat Burning Soup can be eaten at any time you feel hungry in the
day.  Eat as much as you wish as often as you like.  This soup will NOT add
calories.  The more you eat the more you lose.  NO FRIED FOOD OR BREAD.
You may eat broiled or baked chicken instead of meat (no skin on chicken).

Any prescribed medicine will not hurt you on this diet.  Continue this plan
as long as you wish and feel the difference in both mental and physical
disposition.  If you prefer you can substitute broiled fish for the beef on
ONLY ONE of the beef days.  You will need the high protein beef the other
day.

  6                     carrots
  6                     green onions -- or 2 large onions
  1                can  tomatoes -- (16 ounce)
  1               head  cabbage -- large
  2               cans  green beans -- (8 ounce)
  2                     green peppers
  1              bunch  celery
  7                     chicken bouillon cube -- or  beef bouillon

                        Optional:
                        Salt -- pepper, parsley,
                        salsa, 1/2 bunch of cilantro, 12 garlic

Instructions:

This plan is based on one devised by a hospital for its overweight heart
patients.  Follow it exactly (NO CHEATING) and you could lose five to seven
pounds - a good start - in three days.

Each day, whenever you are hungry eat as much of our diet soup as you want,
plus the additional food specified.  Drink only water, unsweetened tea, and
cranberry juice.  Do not drink alcohol or carbonated beverages.

Cut vegetables into small pieces.  Place with bouillon cubes or powder in a
large pot.  Fill the pot a quarter of the way with water.  (This requires
an enormous pot (16 Quart) and  a  lot of containers to put it in.)

Vegetables give off liquid as they cook, but you may need to add more
water.  Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 10 minutes.  Reduce
heat, and simmer until vegetables are tender.

DAY ONE
Eat only the soup plus any fruit except bananas.

DAY TWO
Eat soup plus all the  RAW vegetables, you can stuff down (no beans, peas
or corn).  Be sure to eat some green leafy vegetables.  For treat, dip
veggies in salsa.  At dinner, eat one baked potato topped with butter.  Eat
no fruit on day two.

DAY THREE
Eat all the soup, vegetables, and fruit you want.  No potato  today.

Calico Bean Soup

Package of beans
Packet of spices
Hambone, hamhock or 1/2 pound of ham*
2 quarts of water
1 large onion, chopped
1 28 ounce can of tomatoes or 2 14-1/2 ounce cans
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt to taste

*If desired, omit ham and substitute beef, chicken, or vegetable
stock for the cooking water.

Wash beans thoroughly.  Place in a large kettle, cover with water and soak
overnight.  (An alternate method is to bring beans and water to a boil,
remove from heat, and cover and let stand for 1 hour .)  Next drain beans
and add 2 quarts of new water and ham or ham hock (or use broth if
omitting ham).  Simmer slowly for 2-1/2 to 3 hours.  Then add spice
packet, onion, tomatoes (undrained), lemon juice and salt to taste (spice
packet contains no salt).  Simmer another 30 minutes or until beans are
tender.

Take ham from soup.  Remove any bits of ham from bone and return to soup.
If using boneless ham, cut into bite-size pieces and return to soup.
Serve.

Turn into loaf pan, baked in preheated 350F oven for 60 minutes or until
golden and tests done.

cooled.  Refrigerate wrapped.  Freezes well.

Now for the variables, I have made this with no apricots but with one fresh
apple, chopped ( not peeled). I have made this with and without raisins.
Less sweet but good both ways.
I am eager to try it with fresh bluberries in place of the apricots.

Ingredients:
                  ****

Instructions:

--I use a variety of things for stuffing calzone.  The only time I ever
had a soggy problem was when I used too much ff ricotta.  I always either saute
or roast the veggies before I put them in the dough.  I think they would be
too runny otherwise.  I like to use a cheese base (a little ff ricotta, ff
mozzarella and real honest to goodness reggio parmesan - a little adds a
lot of flavor and not a lot of fat) and then pile the veggies on top.  Also
good is frozen chopped spinach.  Just thaw it out, squeeze all the moisture
out and mix it with the cheese.  Don't forget the garlic and the last of
the good summer tomatoes! [GINN <VMMILL00@UKCC.uky.edu>]


--I love making calzone.  They are especially great to take on hikes
and picnics because they are really yummy cold.  I usually make a
whole wheat dough.  One of my favorite kinds that I made had pesto
for the sauce, some spinach leaves, mushrooms, and red onions.  Also
some sort of white ff or lf cheese, I forget what...  I also make them
with a tomato sauce and whatever veggies I can find.  Last time I
think I had mushrooms, fresh basil, fresh spinach, onions,
and different colored bell peppers.  I made them for a hike that I
went on with a friend and my SO.  They both liked them a lot.
Oh, I don't cook the veggies, just cut them up and wrap them in the dough
bake in the oven. [Jessica Shawl]

--I just made calzone this weekend.  I varied the fillings a little bit,
but I used:
raw chopped broccoli
raw chopped zucchini
sauteed mushrooms
fatfree ricotta mixed with frozen spinach
Yves. fat-free meat-free "pepperoni"
and a little mozzarella and plenty of homemade tomato sauce

I was amazed at how pepperoni-like the fake pepperoni was.  It was almost
too meaty for me to eat!
I didn't cook the broccoli and zucchini because I figured that inside
that baking calzone was essentially a little steam bath.  The vegetables
were fine--not crunchy at all.  I think cooking them would make them too
mushy.
I cooked the mushrooms because I didn't think they'd get too mushy and
because when I put raw mushrooms on pizza, it isn't as good as sauteed
ones.  Maybe they didn't need to be cooked.
I wasn't that impressed with the fat-free ricotta, but it was OK.  I
didn't use very much, so maybe I should use more (since I can't really
taste it now).
Fresh spinach would be better than frozen, especially if cooked with the
mushrooms.  I didn't have any on hand, though.

I had problems with leakage as well.  Actually, I think I was trying to
spread my dough too thin, so I easily punctured it.  Also, I was cramming
loads of stuff into each one.
I wrap the dough around the filling like a burrito, because when I crimp
the edges, it never sticks.
I like making this type of thing--dough around some veggie filling.  I
got the idea from those "Veggie Pockets" from Ken and Robert (I think
that's the brand.)  I make them with chinese veggies, indian curry, and
pinto bean fillings.  Then I freeze them so that when I come home feeling
lazy, I can just pop them in the oven and eat.  Sometimes I'll make the
filling one day, and the actual pockets the next.  [Susan Lehman]

Recipe:      Calzones

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1                cup  warm water -- (approx 110-115
                        degrees F)
  5 1/2      teaspoons  dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- or honey
  5 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  10 1/2          cups  flour
                        --or- substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour

Instructions:


Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large bowl.  Add salt and 1 cup of
flour with a wisk.  Continue to add flour until dough is too thick to wisk, then
use your hands.  Knead dough in bowl for about 5 minutes (a little longer if
you're using whole wheat flour).  Form dough into a ball and slightly flatten.
Rub top of dough with olive oil (this is added fat I have never been able to
avoid using, if you don't do this, the top of the dough dries out while it is
rising.)  Put dough in bowl, oiled side up and cover with towel or wax paper (
plastic wrap sticks!).  Let rise in warm spot for approx. 1 hour.  The recipe
says to divide dough into six parts for calzones.  I always use this dough
for pizza crust and divide it in half.

             Pizzas & Calzones
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1                Cup  reduced fat Bisquick(r) -- lowfat
     1/4           Cup  skim milk
  1         Tablespoon  skim milk
  2              Whole  Italian sausage -- (turkey)sweet,sliced
     1/3         Whole  onion -- chopped
  1              Whole  portobello mushroom -- chopped
     1/3         Whole  red bell pepper -- chopped
     3/4           Cup  frozen mixed vegetables
                        parmesan cheese

Instructions:

Bisquick dough :  1 cup of bisquick and 1/4 cup + 1 TB milk  for each calzone
(these were big).  Mix dough with fork until it sticks together.  Sprinkle
a 1/4 cp or so of flour or bisquick on the counter or cutting board, roll
the dough in it until it looses enough stickiness to handle easily.  Knead it
3 or 4 times, and pat it into a circle, about 1/4 inch thick and about 8-10
inches in diameter.  Make sure it isn't stuck  before you fill it :-).

Filling:  For 2 large calzones I used 2 sweet italian turkey sausages, sliced,
and sauteed them with a chopped portobello mushroom, 1/3 of a white onion,
1/3 of a red pepper (all chopped into 1/2 inch chunks), and about 3/4 cup of
frozen veggies (the mix was snap peas, peppers, water chestnuts and broccoli).
The frozen veggies provided enough moisture for the sauteeing.  Set that
aside while you make the dough.  Spray a cookie sheet with Pam, and preheat
the oven to 400.  Fill each calzone, a sprinkle with a little parmesan cheese
inside (if desired), and put a large tablespoon of tomato sauce or spaghetti
sauce inside.  fold over, and roll bottom edge over top edge (keeps it
from leaking)  Bake 15-20 minutes until lightly browned.

NOTE::  I realized after I made these that regular Bisquick is very high in
sodium and very high in fat-1/2 cup has 700 mg sodium, and 8 grams fat!
Next time, I will make dough myself, and I will try 1 cup of flour with 2
tsp baking powder and 1/4-1/2 tsp salt per calzone.  Or I will check out
low-fat Bisquick, and see if the difference is appreciable enough to buy that.

Ingredients:
                        Dough:
  8             Ounces  wholemeal flour
  4             Ounces  malted flour
                 Pinch  salt
  1           Teaspoon  sugar
     1/2       Package  yeast -- instant
                        Filling:
  1              Whole  onion -- chopped
  2             Cloves  garlic -- chopped
  3              Whole  tomatoes -- peeled and chopped
  1              Whole  red bell pepper -- chopped
  2             Ounces  cheese -- (or 3 oz
                        salt and pepper
                        lemon juice
                        worcestershire sauce
                        paprika
                        cayenne

Instructions:

I made a bread dough with 8 oz wholemeal flour and 4 oz malted flour,
a large pinch of salt, a teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 a sachet of instant
yeast.  I made it in the food processor, using the dough hooks, and
added just enough warm water until it came together in a ball.  Kneaded
it, partly by machine and partly by hand, until it was smooth and no
longer sticky, then put it in a clean bowl, covered with a plate, in
the airing cupboard for about an hour.  Incidentally, I've never felt
the need to coat it with oil - it stays moist enough.

While it was rising, I made the filling of an onion, chopped, 2
cloves of garlic, crushed, 3 tomatoes, peeled and chopped, a red
(bell) pepper, peeled and chopped, 2-3 oz cheese (I didn't weigh
it; just a "nice amount"), grated.  Mixed all together in a bowl
and seasoned with salt, freshly ground black pepper, lemon juice
(about 1/2 - 1 tablespoonful, didn't measure!), Worcester sauce,
paprika and cayenne pepper (Not a lot, Curtis; you can add some
more!).

Rescued the dough, knocked it down, divided it into three.  Rolled
it out very thin on floured surface, roughly circular, piled 1/3
of the filling on each "circle", brushed edges with water, sealed,
and placed on greased baking-sheet.  Baked at gas mark 7 (425 F)
for 20 minutes.  Served with green salad.

The family wants this again very often, so they tell me!

             Meats
             Oriental

Ingredients:
  2             pounds  boneless veal shoulder or white and
                        dark meat turkey
                        Marinade:
  5        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  cold water
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  FiveSpice Powder
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced fine
                        Few sprigs fresh coriander -- for garnish

Instructions:


   This is a versatile recipe. You can prepare it
   in advance; you can slice and serve the meat as
   is; you can stir fry it with vegetables, bean
   curd or noodles. You can also dice it and use as
   a filling for steamed or roasted buns, and,
   finally, you can use it for great sandwiches.

1. Cut the meat into 6 strips 1 half inches wide,
      5 inches long and 2 inches thick.
   2. Combine the marinade ingredients, blending
      thoroughly. Add the meat strips, and turn them
      several times in the marinade to be sure they
      are well coated. Marinate for 1 half hours.
   3. Heat the oven to 350_ F. Fill a large roasting
      pan with 2 inches of water and place it on the
      bottom of the oven. The pan of water will catch
      the drippings and reduce smoking in the oven.
      Place a rack at the top of the oven.
   4. Insert the pointed end of an S hook into one
      strip of meat. Use the other end of the hook to
      hang the meat from the top rack of the oven,
      placing the meat directly over the pan of water.
      Do the same with the remaining strips of meat.
      Roast for 25 minutes, or until done but not dry.
   5. Cut the meat into diagonal slices and arrange on
      a serving platter. Garnish with coriander and
      serve hot or warm.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  Whole-Wheat Flour -- pastry
  1 1/2            Tsp  Baking Powder
  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
     1/2           Tsp  Salt
  1                Tsp  Ground Cardamom
     3/4             C  skim Milk -- or soy milk (vegan)
     1/2             C  Pear -- puree
  2        tablespoons  pear -- puree
                        -- (directions follow)
  2                tsp  Lemon Juice
  1                tsp  Almond Extract
  1                tsp  Vanilla
  2               tbsp  Sucanat -- or 1 t artificial
                        -- sugar
  2               tbsp  Cornstarch

Instructions:

The muffins are mild & light.  Dare I say sophisticated?  Nah.  As usual,
there is the option to omit sugar, for the diabetic consumer.

Preheat oven to 375 deg F.  Coat 10 muffin wells with non-stick spray.
Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In a med bowl,
stir together remaining ingredients.  The cornstarch will tend to stick
together as a lump; make certain it is completely dissolved in the liquid.
 Pour dry ingredients in to wet and stir just
long enough to mix completely.  Spoon batter into the prepared muffin
wells (the wells will be about half-full).

Bake muffins for 25-30 min, until tops are lightly golden.  Allow the
muffins to rest a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack.  Serve,
or cool completely and store in an air-tight container up to two days.

Pear puree:  Puree is easily made by blending, until smooth, half of the
fruit in a 15 oz. container of canned pears (packed in fruit juice is
preferable) .  "Baby food" pureed pears are an even faster alternative.

Note:
If pears packed in juice are used, 1/4 cup of the juice can be substituted
for 1/4 of the soymilk and the sweetener omitted.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  Chickpeas -- cooked
  3        tablespoons  Ground cumin
  1 1/2           cups  Pinto beans -- cooked
  16             whole  garlic cloves
  2               cups  Pumpkin -- cubed
  4              large  Yellow onions -- coarsely chopped
  2             medium  Chayote fruit -- cut into 2"  pieces
  1         tablespoon  Black pepper
  2               cups  Celery root -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  Hot pepper sauce
  2               cups  yucca -- peeled and cubed
     1/4           cup  Olive oil
  2               cups  Battata -- peeled and cubed
     1/4      teaspoon  Salt
  8                     Plum tomatoes -- quartered
     1/2           cup  Fresh cilantro -- chopped

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 300 deg.

     Combine all ingredients in a large roasting pan or casserole dish.

     Place in oven and cook, uncovered, for 4 hours. The pumpkin, chayote
     and
     tomatoes will cook down to a thick sauce. Stir every 30 minutes. Add
     more stock if necessary. Serve hot.
---
Being as how *that* time of year is coming up all too soon, I thought
     I'd get a jump on things by posting some pumpkin recipes that just
     came across rec.food.recipes. I selected these recipes from the
     greater list because they appear to be interesting and *very* easy to
     convert to VLF.

     You can thank me for these recipes in a very simple way:
     tell me what the ingredient "battata" is in the first recipe. This is
     the one I most want to try, and I even have a large yucca root in the
     kitchen, but I don't know what battata is and I'd hate to just omit it
     without at least knowing its basic makeup and thus its contribution to
     the recipe.

     BTW, I see no reason why the first recipe can't be made just as-is
     with only the oil omitted. I don't think a 300 degree F oven is going
     to dry out or scorch the veggies if they are missing 1/4 cup of oil in
     this whole large amount of food. And omitting 1/4 cup of oil in an
     8-serving recipe should bring the per-serving fat grams down from 9 to
     2.

     One other tip on the first recipe, on which I seem fixated. ;-)
     Don't put the cilantro in at the beginning. It will just break down
     under the prolonged heat and contribute nothing to the dish. Stir it
     in just before serving, or don't bother including it at all. Better
     yet, do what we do in our household; provide it at the table. That way
     my cilantrophilic wife can inundate her bowl, and her
     somewhat cilantrophobic husband can use little or none. [Curtis Jackson]

  2              whole  carrots -- finely diced (1 cup)
     1/2           cup  shallots -- chopped
  1                cup  fennel -- finely chopped
  2               cups  rice -- (arborio)

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        fresh ground black pepper -- to taste

Instructions:

In a medium saucepan, bring broth to boil.  Lower heat to simmer.  In a
wide, heavy-bottomed large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat.
Add diced carrots and shallots and cook until shallots begin to soften,
about 6 minutes.  Add fennel and rice and cook, stirring constantly,
until rice is well-coated, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add white wine and cook until
it has been absorbed.  Add 1 cup simmering broth to the large saucepan
and continue cooking, stirring until the stock is almost all absorbed.
Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring and cooking until
broth is absorbed and rice comes away from the side of pot before each
addition.  Continue until all but 1 & 1/2 cups of the broth has been
absorbed, 15 - 20 minutes.

Add broccoli and grated carots and continue cooking and adding the broth,
1/4 cup at a time, until rice is creamy yet firm in center.  This should
take another 5 to 10 minutes.

Remove from heat, stir in Parmesan, juice, zest, thyme, salt, pepper, and
serve immediately.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1                cup  white flour
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  cloves
     3/4           cup  unsweetened applesauce
     1/4           cup  water
  3              large  eggs -- (Or equiv egg
                        substitute.  2 egg whites may
                        be substituted for each whole eggs)
  3               cups  carrots -- coarsely grated
     1/2           cup  raisins

Instructions:


[This is a great cake for breakfast or snacks that's very inexpensive
to make. It not only tastes good but is nutritious as well. It's low
in sugar and has plenty of vitamin A and beta-carotene. The grated
carrots and applesauce keep it moist so there's no need for oil in the
recipe.]

     Using a large mixing bowl, stir together the white and whole wheat
     flours, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves.

     In a small bowl, mix the applesauce, water and eggs. Add this mixture
     to the dry ingredients. Stir until well blended. Then add the carrots
     and blend in well. Finally, add the raisins, stirring until well
     mixed.

     Place the batter in a 9-inch angel food or bundt cake pan coated with
     vegetable oil or no stick cooking spray (or in a nonstick pan so no
     greasing is needed).

     Bake it in a preheated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes to an hour. The
     cake is done when a toothpick stuck in the thickest part comes out
     clean.

     Place the pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes. Then loosen the
     cake by running a knife around the edges of the pan and turn it out on
     the rack for cooling.

     When it's completely cooled, wrap it well in aluminum foil or plastic
     wrap. It'll keep for about a week in the refrigerator this way or for
     several months in the freezer. I like to cut about half of it into
     serving-size pieces, freeze them in individual freezer bags, and pull
     them out as needed.

Ingredients:
                        Extruder: -- (Hand):
  1 1/4              C  Semolina Flour -- (1 C)
     1/8      teaspoon  Nutmeg -- (1/8 T)
  3               Tbsp  Carrots -- To 5 T, Pureed
                        -- (1/3 C)
                        Vegetable Oil -- Optional, Note
                        Water -- If And As Needed

Instructions:

I didn't have any durum semolina so I used bread flour, cooked and pureed
the carrots,  also used cardamom instead of the nutmeg, and eliminated the
oil completely and did not need any water.

NOTE: Vegetable oil is optional for the extruder and not even mentioned for
the hand method.

The cooked and pureed carrots provide a brilliant orange color and adds
extra flavor and nutrition.  The moisture comes from the carrots themselves,
so all the dough to knead prior to adding any additional water.  If you are
not in the mood to cokr and puree carrots, simply use a jar of baby food
carrots.  Watch the dough and adjust as necessary the flour and water.

Variations:
Susbtitute ground coriander or cardamom for the nutmeg.

This is excellent...

  2              large  leeks -- cut into thin

                        this gave a nice richness)
  2          teaspoons  butter
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/2        packet  Butter Buds(r)
                        white wine -- optional
                        pepper to season

Instructions:

"Carrot Paste" will eventually serve around 20 people (quite
possibly more) so don't gasp at the 2 TEAspoons of butter and 2 TEAspoons
of olive oil i used.  it still comes out to less than 1 gram of added fat
per person. [Alekz]

(you could add other seasonings, but i like this one to be simple)

cut leeks in rounds, and break apart the seperate layers.  melt the butter
in olive oil in a soup pot.  add sliced leeks and stir and cover, stirring
every 3 minutes, until leeks become translucent.  add diced garlic and
sliced carrots and add the super strong broth and butter buds.  (i also
added some white wine, sake to be exact).  JUST cover carrots with the
liquid (add some water if nesc.) and turn down to simmer.  simmer for
about 45 minutes to an hour, stirring every 10-15 minutes -- adding liquid
as nesc. to stop burning.   when carrots are tender, and break apart
easily, turn off heat and let cool long enough to transfer to a food
processor.

this mixture needs to be pureed, so a food processor or blender is pretty
necessary.  you could use a ricer, but it could be frustrating.

process in parts until all is a pureed paste.

[i put 4/5 of this in the freezer, the other fifth easily served 4 for
dinner last night with a side of string beans and shittake mushrooms]

  3               cups  raspberries -- frozed and thawed
  1             bottle  Champagne -- (750ml)  chilled

Instructions:


1) Bring water and sugar to a boil in  saucepan, boil and stir
until all sugar is dissolved.  Cool to room temperature.

2) Puree raspberries, press through fine seive.  Discard
seeds.  Makes 1 cup.

3) Add sugar syrup, raspberry puree & champagne to bowl.
Mix and pour into 13x9 inch metal pan.  Freeze, stirring
every 30 minutes for 3-5 hours.

Makes 8 servings

Based on other recipes I've tried that are like this one, I'd say the
consistancy is more like a sorbet.  I forgot to add it to the recipe but the
instructions say to spoon it into champagne glasses to serve.  THEY garnished it
with something that looked like a piece of a waffle cone but of course WE won't

Recipe:      Chard And Cheese Pie

Prep Time:   1:21
Categories:  Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Pies, Crusts & Pastry
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1 1/2        bunches  swiss chard
  2               cups  nonfat cottage cheese
     1/2           cup  nonfat mozzarella cheese -- grated
  4                     egg whites -- beaten
                        (or 2 egg equivalents)
  1         Tablespoon  lemon juice -- (or 1.5 T)
     1/2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  whole wheat bread crumbs -- or other whole grain

Instructions:

This is a recipe my mom always made while I was growing up, and even as a veggie-phobic child I liked it!  It wasn't too high-fat to begin with, and when I tried it adapted to fat-free Icouldn't tell the difference! [Jennefer]

Wash chard and remove stems, then chop into bite-sized pieces.  Cook quickly in
a heavy pan with no added water or oil, stirring constantly until wilted.
 Drain very well, saving the juice for stock.

Beat together cheese, cottage cheese, egg whites, lemon juice, and salt.  Stir
one cup of this mixture into the chard.  Put into a Pam'd 8x8" pan and press
down firmly with a fork.  Spread remaining cheese mixture over top and sprinkle
with bread crumbs and paprika.

Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 30 minutes, or until set (it took my oven
about 35-40 minutes).  Allow to stand several minutes before cutting into
squares and serving.

Variations:  (1) serve chilled with sliced tomatoes and minced parsley; (2)
include sauted onions & mushrooms with the chard.

Notes: This is great at brunches or potlucks.  It also freezes wonderfully.

Ingredients:
  2                     chayote fruit
                        Salt and fresh ground pepper
                        Caribbean Sofrito
  1              Large  tomato -- diced
  1         Tablespoon  chopped cilantro

Instructions:

[The flavor of the chayote (pronounced   shy-OH-tay) squash is pungent and
lends this dish a unique tang. The sofrito is a seasoning you'll use for
different dishes, so save the instructions. It's great with eggs
(EggBeaters, to us) and I'll bet you find other uses, too.  Tree]

Cut the chayotes in half and add to a saucepan of boiling water. Simmer,
uncovered, for about 25 minutes or until just tender. Drain and rinse with
cold water. Remove the skin and the seed core. Cut the remaining squash
into a 1/2" dice.

Heat the Sofrito in saute pan over low heat. Add the tomato, chayote, salt
and pepper and gently stir for a few minutes until heated through. Serve
over brown rice with the cilantro sprinkled on top.

Instructions:

"Fork in the Road", Paul Prudhomme

Makes 7.5 cups, enough for 8 servings

In parts of the South, breakfast or brunch can't be served without
grits. Literally. I remember going into a coffee shop in Florida to
order a late-morning breakfast, but the staff said they were "all
out." Upon questioning, they admitted they had bread to make toast,
eggs that could be cooked any of a dozen ways, bacon, and coffee. But
they were out of grits, so they couldn't offer breakfast. With this
recipe you can serve a really great breakfast or lunch.

Pre-heat a small non-stick skillet over high heat to 400 degrees,
about 4 minutes.

Add the dry grits, and when they begin to brown around the edges, stir
and cook 1 minute more. Stir again and remove from the heat -- the
grits will continue to brown slightly.

Bring water and salt to a rolling boil in a 2-quart saucepan over high
heat. Stir in the grits, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 to 20
minutes, stirring occasionally to be sure the grits do not stick to
the bottom of the pan. If the grits seem to be too thick, add up to 1
cup additional water.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Add the prune and grape syrups to the cooked grits and mix well. Add
the eggs, 4 TABLESPOONS of the Parmesan cheese, and the milk, and mix
until thoroughly blended. Add the flour and baking powder, and blend
in. Spray a 9 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan with vegetable-oil spray, and
pour the grits into it. Sprinkle the REMAINING cheese over the top and
bake for 20 minutes or until a knife inserted comes out clean. Serve
immediately.

Ingredients:
                  ****

Instructions:

As a base for cheese sauce, use a standard white sauce
(directions on the back of the cornstarch box). To make it
low-fat, try these methods:

* use skim milk
* add as much or as little cheese as you like
* use fat-free cheese (takes longer to melt)
* add wine for a richer flavor
* try using Butter Buds or other fake butter flavorings

It's good on vegetables or over pasta.

Instructions:

Here's a muffin recipe I tried the other day from Fast and Healthy magazine.
They were delicious!!!  I only  put FF cream cheese on 6 of the muffins.
The 6 without looked better and tasted just good.

Heat oven to 400 Degrees F. Spray 12 muffin cups with nonstick cooking
spray, or line muffin cups with paper baking cups and spray paper cups with
nonstick cooking spray.

Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off.  In large bowl, combine
flour, sugar, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt; mix well.  In
small bowl, combine pumpkin, milk, oil, and egg whites; blend well.  Add to
dry ingredients all at once; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened.
Spoon batter evenly into spray-coated muffin cups.  Press 1 cream cheese
cube into center of muffin.  Top each with 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar.

Bake at 400 Degrees F for 14 to 18 minutes or until toothpick inserted near
center, but not into cream cheese comes out clean.  Immediately remove from

Ingredients:
                        Crust:
     1/3           cup  margarine -- melted
  1 1/3           cups  graham cracker crumbs
                        Filling:
  1            package  Cool Whip Lite(r)
  1            package  light cream cheese
     1/4           cup  nonfat sour cream
  1         tablespoon  confectioner's sugar
                        fruit or chocolate chips

Instructions:

I mixed 1/3 cup  melted margarine to 1 1/3 cups graham crumbs. This
I formed into a crust in a corning ware casserole dish.

I then mixed 1 large tub of cool-whip light, 1 pkg. light cream
cheese, 1/4 cup no-fat sour cream  and about 1 TBSP of icing sugar to
sweeten. You pour this mixture onto your crust and set for four hours
or so. You could probably add blueberries or cherries and for those
that dare (chocolate chips - just a few though we want to watch that
low fat content)

Ingredients:
  64            ounces  nonfat plain yogurt -- (2-32oz cartons)
     1/2           cup  honey
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  4        tablespoons  arrowroot
  5                     egg whites

Instructions:

Day before drain yogurt to make Yogurt Cheese.

( I used cheesecloth pulled tightly over a large bowl and secured the
cheesecloth with a big rubberband just under the rim and then dumped the
yogurt on top of the cheesecloth and let the liquid drain into the bowl,
voila, yogurt cheese!!)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Prepare Basic Graham Cracker Crust below in a springform pan  and chill
while preparing the cheesecake.

With a rotary beater or hand mixer, beat yogurt cheese, honey, vanilla,
arrowroot and egg whites until thoroughly blended.

Pour filling into chilled graham cracker crust.

Bake at 300 degrees for 60-75 minutes, until center is set and surface is
lightly browned.

Remove from oven, cool to room temperature, refrigerate several hours until
thoroughly chilled.

Ingredients:
                        Cookies
  16            ounces  Neufchatel *cream cheese*
     2/3           cup  nonfat sour cream -- (Breaksone's)
     2/3           cup  chocolate chips
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/8           cup  cocoa powder
  2                     egg whites
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  sugar

Instructions:

Crush cookies to make about 2/3 cup. (I used Peek Frean-Nice) Sprinkle on
bottom of regular cake pan.

Melt chocolate over double boiler, or for 1 and 1/2 to 2 minutes, in
microwave, turning every fifteen seconds, and checking as to not burning
them.  Add one egg white at a time, beating with electric mixer as soon as
they are added until smooth.  Then add the vanilla and sour cream, and beat
until smooth.  Add cream cheese, cocoa,  and sugars and beat until smooth.
Put the cheese mixture over the crumbs, and bake at 400 degree's for 15
minutes, then turn oven down to 240 and bake for approximately 45 more
minutes, until just set.  If it is baked too long, it could become dry.
Chill for 2 hours.  To serve, you may like chocolate curls on top, or little
chocolates.

I know it is not really that low fat, but it is lower fat than the
traditional cheesecake.  It's worth it for Valentine's.

Ingredients:
     2/3           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  water
     1/3           cup  nonfat mozzarella cheese
     1/3      teaspoon  salt -- or less
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  oat bran -- (for texture)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  yeast

Instructions:

I experimented last night and made a pizza crust with this recipe. It is based
on a recipe from the The Bread Machine Cookbook by Donna German. I use her
recipes all the time and rarely have problems. I made the small size and it
made 1 medium thick crust that filled a standard cookie sheet. I bet you could
make the recipe and knead by hand as well. [Heather]

I let my bread machine knead the dough for me. When it was done I spread it on
a cookie sheet sprayed lightly with Pam and let it rise 20-30 minutes.
Preheated the oven to 450F. Sprinkle the dough with some basil (I used dried)
then top the dough with tomato sauce mixed with no fat mozarella cheese and a
little Parmesan. Garnish with raw thinly sliced zucchini. I think it baked 25
minutes or so- I did not time it as I was in the kitchen watching it bake to
make sure it did not burn.

The crust was very crisp. I cut a slice to bring for lunch today and it is
still very crisp- not muchy like leftover pizza sometimes gets.

The dough was very easy to work with so next time I might use it to make
calzones.

the only nut approved by the low-fat Pritikin System.  They are high in
carbohydrates.

California's crop, grown around Sacramento, comes in during Sept, but
imported Italian nuts are here until the first of the year.

Substitute the nuts for other nut types in poultry and wild game stuffings,
breads or cinnamon roll recipes.

Fresh chestnuts must be cooked before being included in recipes.  To prepare
them for baking, preheat the oven to 400 deg F.  Using a short-bladed or
chestnut knife, carve an X onto the flat side of each nut to prevent it from
bursting.

Place the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast in the
preheated oven 15 - 20 min.  (They also may be cooked in the microwave for
about 5 min at full power.)  The nuts should be mealy in the center when
pierced with the tip of a knife.  Remove immediately from the baking sheet
to a thick, clean cloth.  When barely cool enough to handle, crack the nuts
with your hands and use the same knife to peel off the outer shell and then
the funny inner skin.  (At this point you may cover the whole nuts tightly
and refrigerate until needed.)  Coarsely chop the nuts and set aside.

Chestnuts For The Holidays
 Roasting chestnuts is often a tradition during the holidays. Storage
conditions have to be just right, not too dry and not too damp. In dry air,
they dry out and lose quality. In warm, damp air, they mold. Store fresh
chestnuts in the refrigerator in a plastic bag with a few ventilation holes
punched in it.
 Chestnuts can be cooked by roasting, boiling or steaming. To roast over an
open fire, use a long handled popcorn popper or chestnut roaster. To roast in
an oven, try a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes.
 Before roasting, puncture each nut once or twice with an icepick or a knife.
If you fail to do this, pressure from steam building up inside the shells will
cause the nuts to explode, either before or after they come out of the oven or
roaster.
 To boil chestnuts, place them in a shallow pan with water that just covers
them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and boil gently for 15 to 20 minutes.
Drain and partially cool, then remove the kernels using a sharp tine of a table
fork. The longer the nuts cook, the mealier the kernels become and tend to
crumble when removed from the shells. For especially dry chestnuts, soak them
overnight in water before boiling in fresh water.
 For steaming, carefully cut fresh, moist chestnuts in half and cook them in a
vegetable steamer over boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Most kernels should
fall out of the shells during cooking.
 Steamed or boiled nuts can be dipped in melted butter and salted, if desired,
or used in other recipes. Store cooked chestnuts in tightly sealed jars in the
refrigerator for a month or two or in the freezer for up to a year. (MJM)

Ingredients:
  1                 lb  ground chevon
     1/2           med  chopped onion
     1/2                red bell pepper -- chopped
  2                     jalapeno peppers
  1                can  stewed tomatoes -- (28 oz)
     1/2           can  water
                        chili powder to taste
  2               tsps  Cumin
  2               tsps  oregano
  2               tsps  sage
     1/4           cup  dried black beans -- optional
  1               dash  cayenne
  2               tbsp  cornmeal -- to thicken
                        tomato juice -- as needed

Instructions:

Since it's cold weather everywhere, chili makes a warm welcome.  And, since
we raise goats, have a lot of chevon in the freezer, have collected some
interesting ;stats' on goat meat.  3oz cooked chevon -122 cal, 2.58 grams of
fat, .79 grams saturated fat as opposed to the leanest chicken 120 cal, 3.5 g
fat, 1.1 saturated fat.

Put 1 lb ground chevon in a hot skillet to sear. I don't use any oil, just
hover over and stir often, since it doesn't have any fat to cook out of it to
help keep from sticking. Turn the heat down and add 1/2 med chopped onion,
1/2 a chopped bell pepper (red if you have it) and 1-2 jalapeno peppers. I
like the TAM mild ones and use them in place of hot peppers. If you prefer a
milder chili, use 1/2 to 1 pepper, and seed it out, discarding the veins,too.

Cook all that until the onion is translucent. Add 28 oz can of stewed
tomatoes plus about 1/2 can of water.

Add chili powder to taste. this is not hot, so add a generous teaspoonful. 2
tsps each of Cumin, oregano, sage, and a dash of salt if you prefer.  Cook
until it begins to absorb the water from the tomatoes, (break up the whole
tomatoes if you already haven't done so.)

Texans HATE beans in chili, but I like the flavor so I sneak em in. I use an
'instant' flaked black bean, about 1/4 cup to the chilipot.  Stir and let
this thicken and the flake beans cook.  Add cayenne, just a dash to
'brighten' the pot, and about 2 tbsp of either cornmeal or corn masa to
thicken.  if it's too thick, add tomato juice and get it back to the
consistency and color you want.
Makes enough for 4 people

Ingredients:
  5               cups  wheat chex(r)
  5               cups  corn chex(r) -- or Rice Chex
  5               cups  cheerios(r)
  2               cups  pretzels -- (2 to 3)
                        broken into bit sized pieces)
     1/2           cup  nonfat margarine -- melted
     1/2           cup  nonfat italian salad dressing
  2              tbls.  hot sauce -- (2 to 4) Tiger brand
                        (Gives wonderful zip) -- optional
  2              tbls.  soy sauce -- (2 to 4)
                        garlic powder to taste

Instructions:

Mix together the dry ingredients in large bowl.  Melt together margarine and
salad dressing on low heat (may look weird since it won't melt like normal
fat containing margarine, but let it go a few minutes than use a whisk to
mix it and it's fine).  Add Tiger sauce, soy, and garlic powder.  Stir and
turn off heat allowing to cool for a few minutes.

In the meantime, heat up your oven to 250 degrees and spray two cookie
sheets lightly with a garlic or butter flavored spray (Spray is optional)

Drizzle slowly (a little bit at a time) the liquid mixture over the dry
mixture.  Stir, drizzle some more, etc.  I really take my time mixing so
that I don't make anything soggy, and everything gets well coated.

Spread in a single layer on baking sheets and bake 75 minutes.  Every 25
minutes I open the oven, stir the mix a little and close it back up.
Sometimes I reverse which oven racks the pans are on.

When done, shut off the oven and open the door slightly.  I leave
the pans in the oven to cool and continue drying.  Store in an airtight
container.

The cheerios remind me of peanuts--hard and crunchy (They shrink).

We love this zesty snack.  I hope you do to! [Nanci]

Season with salt and pepper.

Heat margarine in a large, heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat until
bubbly.  Add chicken and cook about 10 minutes, turning occasionally, or
until almost opaque in center and golden on both sides.  Remove to serving
plates.  Sprinkle with chives and parsley.

Add wine (and tarragon, if using dried) to skillet and cook over high heat,
stirring in any brown bits on bottom, until reduced to about 3 T.  Stir in
fresh tarragon.  Spoon over chicken.

This is excellent!!

Recipe:      Chicken Broth
By:          Therese Klodnicki
Prep Time:   2:01
Categories:  Chicken
             Eat-Lf Mailing List

Ingredients:
                        chicken carcass
                        onions
                        celery leaves
                        carrot
                        water

Instructions:

I make my own chicken broth using the carcass of a roasted chicken.  After a
roast chicken dinner, I place the bones and any small meat scraps left on the
bones into my crockpot with an onion or two, some celery leaves, sometimes a
carrot or two, and cover all with water.  I let this simmer on low overnight.
In the morning, I strain the broth reserving any meat scraps for soup or other
uses.  Then, I refrigerate the broth.  After the broth cools and the fat
solidifies on top, I take off the fat and store the remaining broth for soups
or other uses.

The same thing can be done on top of the stove, but I like the crockpot
because then you don't have to deal with it again until the next morning.  If
I am not going to be home in the morning, I put everything in the crock pot
bowl, and refrigerate it overnight.  Then, I start it cooking in the morning.
If you are doing it on top of the stove, you could put it all in the frig. and
then put the pot on the stove whenever it was convenient.

             Eat-Lf Mailing List

Ingredients:
                        chicken -- or pieces
                        celery
                        carrots
                        onion
                        garlic
                        bay leaf
                        water

Instructions:

Take a chicken, or chicken pieces, and put it in a large pot with an
onion, quartered, a couple of ribs of celery and a couple of carrots, cut
in about 2-inch pieces. Add a clove or two of garlic, a couple of bay
leaves, and some thyme, parlsey, and marjoram.  Add enough water to
cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.  Or
put it in a crockpot and let it cook all day.  Strain the broth, put in
the fridge, and chill.  Skim off the fat.  The broth will probably have a
jelly-like consistancy.  This is ok.  You can freeze this easily, in
whatever size is most convenient.  I usually freeze some in an ice cube
tray (each cube is about 2 Tbsp). Once they're frozen I pop them out into
a ziploc bag.  Whenever I need a little broth for sauteing, I get a cube
or two out.

(You can use the chicken meat from the above, but I don't usually save
the veggies.  After they've cooked for a couple of hours, they're too
mushy, and most of the flavor has been cooked out of them.)

             Soups & Stews

Ingredients:
  3             Pounds  chicken bones
  2              Whole  carrots -- chunked
  2             Stalks  celery -- chunked
  1              Whole  onion -- cut in 1/8s
                 Sprig  parsley
                 Sprig  fresh thyme -- or 1/4 tsp dried
                        bay leaf
  8              Whole  peppercorns
  2             Quarts  water
                        dried porcini mushrooms -- optional
                        leek -- chopped (optional)_

Instructions:

Making chicken stock is pretty easy. Throw 3 lbs of chicken bones (wings,
necks, bones from boning breasts) or chicken parts in a big pot with 2
carrots, cut in chunks; 2 stalks of celery, cut in chunks; a onion, cut
in 1/8ths; a few sprigs of parsley; a few sprigs of fresh thyme or a 1/4
tsp of dried thyme; a bay leaf; about 8 peppercorns. You can add other
things like a few dried porcini mushrooms or a coarsely chopped leek but
those are extras. I don't usually add salt but you can if you want. Add 2
quarts of water or enough to cover all the stuff in the pot by about 1
inch. Bring to a boil. Skim the scum that rises to the top. Reduce the
heat to a simmmer and cook for about 1 hour, partially covered. Let the
stock cool slightly and strain through cheesecloth to remove all the
solids. If you have used chicken parts, recover those and take the meat
off for chicken salad or some other use. Put the stock in the fridge
overnight and in the morning, the fat will be solidified on the top. You
just spoon it off. Or if you have one of those fatskimming measuring
cups, you can skim the stock that way. I usually freeze my stock in ice
cube trays. When it is frozen, I remove them and toss them in a plastic
bag. It's nice to have small increments of chicken stock since many
recipes call for 1/2 cup.

             Rice

Ingredients:
                        boned and skinned chicken breast halves
  1                cup  instant rice
  1                cup  water
  1                can  lowfat cream of mushroom soup

Instructions:

My favorite mega simple meal is this:

Preheat oven to 350.  Place boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a casserole
dish.  In a bowl, combine 1 cup instant rice, 1 cup water and 1 can of
condensed
cream of mushroom soup (I use the low fat soup).  Pour rice mixture over
chicken.  Cover and bake at 350 for 1 hour.  I usually remove the cover and let
it bake a little longer so it browns on top.

Really easy and really good!  I have thought about trying it in my crockpot.  I
think the best meals are not only easy to make and good to eat but are also
ready when you get home.

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           Cups  cooked chicken breast halves -- shredded

  1                Can  black beans

  1                Cup  cooked rice

Instructions:

Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray (I think I use a 9x9" pan).  Tear 2
or 3 of the tortillas into quarters & line the bottom of the pan. Top with a
layer of beans.  Add layer of cheese.  Layer of chicken.  Layer of rice.  Start
with tortillas again & repeat layers.  End with a layer of rice.  Pour the
sauce over the top & spread evenly to keep the rice from turning into gravel
in the oven.  Bake at 200 for about 20 minutes.  Just to heat everything
through.

  31            ounces  canned garbanzo beans -- drained
                        cayenne (or other heat source) -- to taste

Instructions:

I made this last night and it was a big hit. My wife liked the
heat level as-is; I added a tablespoon or so of Hell Hot brand
habanero sauce to my bowl.  ;-)   I hadn't eaten lunch at all,
so I followed the bowl of chili with a bean burger in a pita
with Inner Beauty sauce, ketchup, black pepper, garlic powder,
and chipotle powder. Yum! What a nice endorphin-stimulating
evening meal!! [Curtis]

The chicken, tomatoes, and garbanzos are an excellent combination,
but since the chicken is boneless and skinless it doesn't impart
much flavor. I think this chili would be just as good with TVP
chunks; the chewiness is all you're really after.
saute the onion, bell pepper, and garlic over high heat in a little of
the stock until tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook 2
minutes or until just cooked, stirring constantly. Add chili powder,
ground cumin, coriander, chipotle powder, and salt. Cook 1 minute,
stirring constantly. Add chiles, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, beer,
broth, chipotle puree, and bay leaves. Cover, reduce heat, simmer 40
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garbanzos, adjust heat with
cayenne or other heat source if desired, and cook, uncovered, an
additional 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Discard bay leaves and
serve as-is or over rice.

Ingredients:
  1                Tsp  Olive Oil -- optional *
  1                cup  onion -- chopped
                        (1/2 red and 1/2 yellow onion)
     1/2           cup  anaheim chili pepper -- chopped
                        and poblano pepper
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- cooked and cubed
  16                Oz  black beans -- rinsed and drained
  1           teaspoon  Salt
     1/4           tsp  Black Pepper
  3               tbsp  Cornstarch -- dissolved in
  6               tbsp  Cold Water
  1 1/2              C  Water
  2                     Chicken Bouillon Cube
  4                 oz  Fatfree Monterey Jack Cheese -- shredded **
  12                    Corn Tortillas -- 6"
  3                     Roma Tomato -- sliced for garnish
  1                jar  Salsa -- optional,
                        served on side

Instructions:

** or  8 oz package  Low Fat Monterey Jack Cheese -- shredded
                        (or substitute 4 oz no fat Mozzarella, 4 oz reg. Jack)

Cook chicken.

Note: be careful not to let Saran wrap touch food while microwaving or it will
start to melt and be careful removing Saran wrap from microwave dish after
heating because live steam may burn your fingers.

Coat small skillet with olive oil then saute onion, peppers and garlic
(alternatively, saute onion, peppers, garlic in microwave dish covered with
Saran wrap with no oil about 2-3 minutes). Combine onion mixture with chicken,
beans, salt, and pepper; set aside.

In 4 cup Pyrex glass measuring cup, microwave water with bouillon cubes about 3
minutes and stir to dissolve. Add cornstarch dissolved in cold water and stir.
Cover with Saran and return to microwave. Microwave about 3 minutes, stirring
about every minute until sauce begins to thicken. Gradually add half of grated
cheese, stirring to form a cheese sauce. If sauce is slightly lumpy with
cheese, this won't be noticeable once enchiladas are cooked.

Dip each tortilla into hot cheese sauce to soften; fill each with chicken
mixture and a little sauce. Roll up. Arrange enchiladas in 9 x 13 x 2" glass
baking dish (if 8 x 12, use fewer tortillas). Pour remaining sauce over
enchiladas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and garnish with tomato slices.
Cover with Saran wrap and microwave about 12 minutes until hot and bubbly.

Serve with salsa.

             Sauces & Gravies

Ingredients:
  3             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  1           teaspoon  butter -- or butter-flavored
                        Pam
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
     1/2            lb  fresh mushrooms -- sliced
     1/2           cup  white wine
  3             sprigs  fresh parsley -- (to 4)
     1/4           tsp  thyme
     1/4           tsp  basil
                        salt and pepper to taste
  1               pint  nonfat sour cream

Instructions:

Lightly brown chicken pieces in small amount of butter (1-2 tsp) or spray
pan with butter-flavored Pam before browning chicken.  Remove chicken to
a plate and brown onion and mushroom in the pan you used to brown the
chicken.  Put chicken pieces back in pan and add next 4 ingredients.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and cook for 30-45 minutes
or until chicken is done.  (Don't overcook or chicken will be dry.)
Remove chicken pieces to a serving dish and keep warm.  If there are more
than 2 or 3 tablespoons of liquid in the pan, turn up the heat and cook
until the sauce condenses to 2-3 tbsp.  Then stir in the fat-free sour
cream until smooth and heated through.  Do not boil.  Pour sauce over
chicken and serve extra on the side.  This is very good with noodles.  I
served it with homemade herb-flavored spaetzle from Raichlen's lowfat
cookbook.

Sour cream should be added at the end of the cooking time.

Ingredients:
  2              large  shallots
  4             medium  tomatoes -- about 1 lb
  1                     frying chicken -- cut up and skinned
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  chicken stock
     1/2      teaspoon  dried tarragon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  butter -- (1 to 2) optional

Instructions:

1. Mince the shallots. Seed the tomatoes and dice.

2. Heat canola oil in pressure cooker. Add chicken and brown
on both sides. Remove from cooker and set aside.

3. Add vinegar to pan and scrape up any browned bits. Add the
shallots and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes,
wine, stock, tarragon, salt and pepper to taste. Arrange the
chicken on top. Cover pressure cooker and bring to high
pressure. Reduce heat to maintain pressure and cook for 10
minutes. Release pressure and remove the chicken.

4. Increase the heat to high and boil the sauce until it
thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining
butter if desired and adjust the seasonings.

The butter makes the sauce a little thicker and richer. You
could also thicken it with 1/2 tbl cornstarch dissolved in
2 tbl of cold water.

The sauce is very tasty, not too tart. It was a big hit in
my house. [Sharon]

  1                can  canned chicken -- Tyson White
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
  1               Tbsp  Lemon Juice
  1                Tsp  Salt

Instructions:

Combine all ingredients and refrigerate before using
This is good.  For personal reasons I prefer not to use Tyson chicken.  You can
substitue another brand if you wish, but I find it just as easy to simmer a
chicken breast and use that torn into pieces.  I would add a taste of the
broth.

  1                     green bell pepper
  1              large  onion -- chopped

     1/2           cup  frozen corn -- ( or can use green

                        black pepper
  1                     bay leaf

Instructions:


 In a large pot, put chicken (minus innards, etc.), garlic salt,
pepper, Creole, Back Bay, or other seasoning, & bay leaf.  Cover
with water.  Cook chicken 1 hour.  While chicken is cooking, chop
onions, celery, and green bell pepper. Most people put carrots in
their soup, but I don't like carrots, so I leave them out.
Remove chicken from stock. Cool, skin, bone, and cut up.  Leave
time for chicken to cool - it's no fun to bone hot chicken.  Give
the skin and wing tips to the dogs, but not the bones.  Chicken
bones are not good for dogs.  Reserve 1/2 of the breast for
chicken salad another day.    While meat is cooling and being
boned, let stock cook down some.    Skim fat off stock. Add
chicken, tomatoes, chicken broth, onions, celery and green bell
pepper to stock.   Add more seasoning if desired.  A dash or two
of Tabasco sauce wouldn't hurt a baby.   Cook 1/2 hour.  Quarter
potatoes(or cut into bite size pieces, if using larger potatoes.) Add
potatoes and corn or beans  to soup.  Cook another 1/2 hour.  Like all
soups, it's better the next day.

                        onion -- chopped
                        garlic -- chopped
                        soy sauce
                        sesame oil
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  chili paste
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        broccoli
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
                        cornstarch

Instructions:

The "secret" ingredients are chili paste w/ garlic and hoisin sauce -
these will probably require a trip to the oriental supermarket. A "good"
soy sauce helps also.

The amounts are all to taste - I don't measure anything so I'm making up
the amounts. The quantities can't be critical because the meal always
tastes good.

cut up chicken breast and trim any fat that you see. sprinkle on some
white pepper, ginger, soy sauce, and white wine. Let it soak for abut
20 minutes.

Chop carrots, onions, garlic, and any other long cooking veggies you want in
the
dish. Put them in a bowl, add about 1 Tbsp. of soy, a dash of sesame oil
and nuke for 2 or 3 minutes.

Put about 1/4 cup of chicken broth (I use bouillon) in a wok, add more
garlic (you can't have too much garlic) and when it's boiling, add the
chicken. When the chicken is white and you don't see anymore pink, add the
carrots and other veggies. Add 1 tsp. chili paste (more if you like it
hotter), 1 Tbsp. of hoisin, 2 Tbsp. of soy. I'll also add broccoli at this
time. Add about 1/2 cup chicken broth. When it boils add some corn starch
to thicken it.

I've been making this for years and I love it. I use to start with oil in
the wok and cook everything there. I've only been doing the above method
for a few weeks but it seems to work. No oil and the food doesn't stick.

Instructions:

This is a lighter version of the classic but it is very good!!

*NOTE:  The original recipe called for 2 T oil.  It didn't need that much.

Heat the oil in a large skilllet over med-high heat.  Working in batches to
avoid overcrowding the skillet, add the chicken to the skillet; cook,
stirring occasionally, until golden and no longer pink in the center, about
6 min.  Transfer chicken to a plate.

Reduce the heat to med.  Add the mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the
mushrooms release their juices and are golden and tender, about 6 min.  (If
the skillet becomes too dry, add 1 or 2 tsp of the chicken broth, or more as
needed.)

Meanwhile, stir together the flour and 2 T of the milk in the measuring cup
until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain.  Stir in the remaining milk
until well blended.

Return the chicken to the skillet.  Increase the heat to med-high.  Add the
chicken broth to the skillet.

Stir flour mixture, salt, paprika and black pepper into skillet.  Bring to
boiling.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer, stirring occasionally, until
mixture thickens slightly, about 5 min.  Serve with hot cooked rice.

This is EXCELLENT!!

                        skim milk

Instructions:

crush about 3 cups of crisped rice cereal, add some steak
seasoning (I used Adam's), pepper, celery seed (very small amount) OR use
your favorite fried chicken seasonings.  I dipped a pound of chicken
tendersin milk then in the crumbs and placed the pieces on a Pam-ed sheet of
aluminum foil.  There were enough crumbs that you could probably do another 1/2-3/4
pound of chicken.

For the tenders, I baked them at 375 for 15 minutes, turned them and baked
for another 10.  It was the first time I'd made anything like that and I'd
probably shorten the time.  For bone-in chicken, you'd want to bake the
pieces for about 40 minutes.

Also, for the first dip I'll probably combine egg whites and milk or water
to make it a little stickier.

                        salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:

Melt 1 teaspoon margarine in large saucepan and brown the chicken.  Remove
from pan and drain on paper towels on a platter.
Melt the remaining margarine in the pan and sauti the onion and garlic,
covering the saucepan, until the onions are clear.
Place the chicken back in the pan, sprinkle with paprika and cayenne, and pour
the bouillon in.  Simmer, covered, until the chicken is tender.
Again, remove the chicken from the pan, and remove the pan from the burner.
Let the bouillon cool for several minutes.  Cooling is essential to prevent
the dairy products from curdling.
When the bouillon is lukewarm, stir in the yogurt and the milk until smooth.
Replace the skillet over low heat, add salt and pepper to taste, and put the
chicken back in.
Reheat until hot, but do not let the sauce boil!
The chicken contains approximately 300 calories for a 6-oz serving.  Add 10

Instructions:

I had never thought of putting
radishes on them - I'll have to try this.  One thing that I did to lower
the fat content even further was to "fry" my chicken in chicken broth (I
use low fat powdered with a little water).  If there is any broth left over
I just drain it before continuing.  The chicken turns out really tender
this way. [Linda]

In medium fry pan add chicken, garlic, water, stock, onion and green
pepper.  Cook over medium heat until chicken is cooked through and
vegetables are slightly tender (water will probably evaportate during
cooking time).  If there is still water in pan - drain. Heat salsa in
microwave till hot. Divide chicken mixture between two tortillas, add
salsa, lettuce and tomato. Enjoy.

  1             bottle  beer -- dark

Instructions:

Brown chicken in the spices & a little bit of the beer.  When the chicken is
browned on both sides, add the rest of the ingrediants.  I always crush the
tomatoes with my hands.  If you do this, hold them low to the pan or you will
have tomato *everywhere*.  Cook until chicken is done (no pink).  Serve with
Spanish Rice.

For your chicken wings:  Throw away the little bony, fat end.
Pull the skin off the part with the meat on it.  Make crumbs out
of a slice of bread.  Season the bread.  Roll the wings in the
crumbs and bake in a pan you have sprayed with PAM or WW spray.
If you can't get enough crumbs to adhere to the chicken, try
dipping it on skimmed milk before you roll it in the crumbs.

By:          (Katherine Rodman)
Prep Time:   1:45
Categories:  Chicken
             Eat-Lf Mailing List

Ingredients:
  1               3 Lb  chicken -- cut into pieces (3
                        to 4)
  2        Tablespoons  olive oil -- (or 1 T)
                        salt and pepper
  40             Large  garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  1 3/4           Cups  dry white wine
  4                     thyme -- or 1/4 tsp dried
  1                     rosemary -- or 1/4 tsp dried
  8                     croutons -- garlic flavored
  2        Tablespoons  Cognac

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove skin from chicken pieces.

Heat oil over medium heat in a heavy bottomed flameproof casserole wide
enough to accomodate the chicken in a single layer.  Add the chicken, and
salt and pepper lightly. Saute for 5 minutes, then turn over and saute for
another 5 minutes.  Remove the chicken pieces from the pot.

Add the garlic and saute, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes until beginning to
brown.  Spread the cloves in a single layer and return the chicken piece to
the pot.  Add the wine, thyme and rosemary and cover tightly.

Place the casserole in the oven and bake 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, make the
garlic croutons.

After 45 minutes, check the chicken.  It should be tender andd fragrant.  If
it is not quite cooked through or very tender, bake another 15 minutes.

Remove the casserole from the oven.  Heat the Cognac in a small saucepan and
light with a match.  Pour over the chicken and shake the casserole until the
flames die down.  Taste the sauce in the pot, adjust the seasonings, and
sprinkle with parsley.

To serve, place a couple of croutons on each plate, a piece of chicken or
two, topped with some of the sauce in the pan and several garlic cloves,
which your guests should squeeze out onto the croutons.

Serves 4

Ingredients:
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- light (reduce)
  2              whole  chicken breasts
  2              whole  apples
  1               head  cabbage -- coarsely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- sliced
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- seeded and cut into
                        strips
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  caraway seed

Instructions:

Heat 1/4 c. mild, light-flavored olive oil in a heavy soup pot or Dutch oven.
 Saute 2 whole chicken breasts, skinned and halved, until browned.  Remove
from pot and set aside.  Add 2 apples, cut into wedges, to the pot and saute
for 5 minutes.  Remove from pot and set aside.  Add 1 large head cabbage,
coarsely sliced, 1 medium onion, sliced, 1 medium green bell pepper, seeded
and cut into strips, and stir-fry until tender.  Add 1 Tblsp. brown sugar, 1
Tblsp. cider vinegar, and 1/4 tsp. caraway seeds.  Return apples and chicken
to pot.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 35 minutes until chicken
is tender.  (4 servings)

That's what the original recipe said.  I don't see why one couldn't
*drastically* reduce the oil, or even replace it with defatted chicken broth
or wine in which to saute.

Instructions:

 Start the beans soaking in 6-8 c warm water.  I rinse and change water

>
> After soaking, in fresh water, bring to a slow rolling boil for an hour.
> Start at hi and reduce to med once the beans start boiling.  Keep almost
> covered, or you will end up with a steam bath in the kitchen. Stir
> every 15 minutes.  Add water if necessary.
>
> Start everything else when you turn the heat up on the beans.
> Saute the garlic in a tbls of the vegetable broth on med in a 2-3 qt pan.
> Chop the onion and add to the garlic, adding the rest of the broth.
> Chop and add the green and red peppers, mushrooms and the celery.
> Continue the saute for about 15 mins until the veges are softened.
> Add the salsa, tomatoes and tomato paste.  Add the can of corn (drained).
> Add the chile seasoning, and continue to simmer on low, stiring occasionally.
>
> When the beans are done, drain, rinse and return to to the pot and add
> the veges and chile mix.  It's basically done at this point, but gets
> better as the beans soak up some of the chile flavor, so I leave on low for

> Keeps a week or more in the fridge.

Instructions:

Wash 1 cup dry pinto beans and pick out debris and rocks.  Put pinto beans
in 3 cups water.  Bring to a boil and turn off heat.  Let soak one hour.
Then simmer beans until soft adding water if needed.  Beans should absorb
most of the water.

In separate pan, cook 1/4 cup pearl barley per package directions.  Add
liquid as needed. You want some liquid at the end.

Add barley with its cooking liquid to beans.  Add 1/2 cup (or more)
granular TVP (optional but recommended).

From here, you wing it.  Add tomato paste or sauce, onion, garlic, chili
powder, salt and cumin to taste.  If you like chunk tomatoes, use that
instead of tomato paste.  If you have a can of Rotel tomatoes with green
chilis, put it in.

Ingredients:
                        dried chili peppers
                        sherry

Instructions:

You take dried red chilli peppers (presumably
your jalapenos; we don't make such distinctions here!) and place
them in a clean bottle full of sherry, and allow them to steep for
about three weeks.  The resultant fluid makes a delicious spicy
addition to soups and stews, and you can top up with sherry a time
or two before the chillis lose their potency.

Prep Time:   2:40

             Soups & Stews
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  3               cups  orange juice -- (preferably fresh
                        squeezed)
  3               cups  buttermilk -- or yogurt
  1                  T  fresh lemon Juice -- or lime juice,(to 2
                        Tbs)
                        optional: 1 to 2 Tbs sugar or honey
  2               cups  berries -- (up to 3 cups) any
                        kind or combination (frozen OK)

Instructions:

Whisk together orange juice and buttermilk or yogurt.  Add
lemon or lime juice and optional sugar or honey (or not), to taste.
Cover and chill until serving time.

When you're ready to serve, place about 1/2 cup berries in
each bowl.  Ladle the soup on top.  If desired, dust very lightly with
cinnamon and/or nutmeg, and garnish with a few small sprigs of mint.

	Now, my production notes.  I made it for myself for a snack and
used 1/2 cup of the OJ and 1/2 cup of nonfat yogurt.  Used a touch of
lime juice and then added some defrosted frozen raspberries.  I  found
that the raspberries had sugar in them, so I didn't need to add any extra
sugar.  Those proportions might be a bit much (this was a big bowl of
stuff: next time I'll use 1/4 cup each of the yogurt and OJ if I'm just
making it for myself).  With the nonfat yogurt, there was nothing that
listed fat in the ingredients, so I think it's pretty safe.  Made a
pretty color, too, with the light orange and the bright raspberry
juice. :)  The author recommends it as a summer beverage, a breakfast
dish or a dessert.

Ingredients:
                        Dressing for Pasta:
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce
                        Dressing for Salad:
     1/4           cup  vegetable broth
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar -- or rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste
                        chili oil -- to taste
                        Salad:
  1              pound  spaghetti -- cooked and warm
     1/2         pound  snow peas -- trimmed and cut
                        diagaonally into1" pieces
  2              whole  cucumber -- peeled,seeded, and
                        cut into 1/4 x 1 1/2" strips
  1              bunch  scallion -- cut diagonally
  1              stalk  celery -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  fresh parsley -- snipped
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds

Instructions:

Blanch snow peas for 1 minute and then quickly cool.

[It does have some added fat, to toss with the spaghetti so it doesn't
stick together.  I reduced the amount--so you have to spend a little more
time tossing it to make sure it coats the pasta.]

1. In a large bowl, combine the dressing ingredients for *pasta*, and
toss them with the warm pasta.  Set aside.  (This may be done one day
ahead, but bring pasta to room temp before finishing the salad.)

2. In a smalle bowl or jar, combine the dressing ingredients for the
*salad*.  Set aside.

3. At serving time, toss the pasta with the dressing for salad.  Add all
salad ingredients and toss again.
  (I did this long before serving, and it was fine.)

I REALLY like this salad.  The crunchy veggies go really well with the
soft pasta.

                         -- (the best of the
                        light box mixes)
  1                qt.  softened Raspberry Frozen Yogurt -- (ie Crowley)

Instructions:

Bake brownie mix for 20 minutes at manufacturers instructions in a
9 x 13 pan.
Let cool and spread with frozen yogurt.
Top with cracker crumbs
It doesn't sound like much, but tastes great.  You can substitute any
of the above with other brands, I just have had success with those brands.
To make it look like I worked a little harder (if I'm having company over)
I cut the dessert in squares and top each square with some fresh raspberries
or other available fruit (orange slices look nice) and a few sprigs of mint.

  3             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- melted
                        --or 9 tblsp. cocoa
  2               cups  unsweetened applesauce
  1                cup  sugar
  2               cups  flour -- unbleached
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  vanilla -- (suggested)

Instructions:


Prehead oven to 350. Spray Pam on a 7 x 12" baking dish.
Combine ingredients in the order they appear. Stir well. Spread the batter
inthe pan.
Bake for 25 minutes, or until top springs back in the center when lightly
pressed.

[I did not have unsweetened applesauce, so used sweetened one,
but omitted the sugar.  I also changed the flour, to one cup flour and one
whole wheat.  What came out was great.
The next time I will make one other change, instead of unsweetened chocolate
I will try it with cocoa. It is three tablespoons per ounce. Jenka Guevara]

  4          teaspoons  Sweet 'n Low(r) sweetener -- *
  1                tsp  Vanilla

Instructions:

* (sugar twin is one that remains sweet after cooking)
           (or 1/4 Cup sucanat)

  Put raisins in a small bowl and pour over 1/2 cup boiling water.
Set asside to steep for 20 minutes.  In a large bowl, blend
together cocoa and 3/4 Cup boiling water.  Set cocoa asside to cool.
  Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat a 9-inch cake pan with
non-stick spray.  Dust pan with 1 or 2 Tbsp flour, coating completely.
  Over a medium bowl, sift together flour, soda, and salt.  Transfer
raisins and water to the beaker of a hand-held mixer or blender and
puree.  Add beets and and 3/4 of the 1 cup cool water to
the puree.  Dissolve cornstarch in remaining 1/4 cup water.  Stir
raisin and beet puree, dissolved cornstarch, sugar, and vanilla into
cocoa mixture.  Before proceding, this mixture should be at room
temperature.
  Quickly stir dry ingredients into cocoa mixture.  Do not stir
longer than needed to thouroughly mix the two.  Scrape batter into
prepared pan and smooth the surface.  Bake on top shelf for 35 to 40
minutes, or until a toothpick inderted in the middle of the cake
comes out clean.
  Let cake sit in pan for 10 to 15 minutes and then remove to a
wire rack.  Cool cake completely before cutting.

I have been baking it in one big (9") round pan.  It comes out looking
a bit, um, rustic, with a rough surface rather than a smooth one.  If you
dust the top with abit of cocoa, through a wire mesh, it will look
quite nice.  (Powdered sugar would do the trick too, if you use it)  I think
you could bake the cake in two thinner (8") layers, just be sure to decrease
the cooking time.

Not my recipe, Tina Hulbe's on the low fat list.  But a chocolate-beet cake
type recipe none the less.  And I haven't even converted it to English :-)

             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1                cup  flour
     1/2           cup  sugar -- or more
     1/2           cup  cocoa
  2          teaspoons  flavoring (raspberry,orange, or almond)
  2              whole  Egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        splash liquor -- ie, Chambord
                        semisweet chocolate -- melted,optional

Instructions:

Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, salt and baking baking powder.  Separately, mix flavoring and
eggs.  Combine.  Add splash of liquor or water as needed to have a sticky consistency.  If
the mixture is too stiff, it won't spread out properly.

Put this glob on a greased cookie sheet and arrange it into a log about 15 inches long and
1 1/2 - 2" wide.  Bake at 350 for 25 minutes.  Remove from oven, let cool a few minutes,
then slice diagonally into 1/2- 3/4" slices.  I got 18 pieces from mine.  Place the slices
on their side and put back in the oven (300 degrees) for 15 minutes.  Turn over and cook
another 10-15 minutes.

If you can afford the fat, a small drizzle of semisweet chocolate is wonderful on these
when cooled.  I used about 2 T. for all the cookies, which added about 6 g. fat to the
recipe or 1/3 g. fat  each one.

  2                tsp  Cornstarch
                 pinch  Salt

Instructions:

Last night I finally tried the chocolate bread recipe in "Sweet Nothings"
and it was GREAT! The only fat comes from that which is in 1/3 C. of cocoa
powder and the bread. It's supposed to have 3 eggs, but I didn't have any
eggs so I used substitute instead and it was fine.

Even though I was out of a lot of the ingredients, I managed to make-do
with what I had on hand. Perhaps it would've been tastier if made exactly
according to recipe, but as it stands it's pretty damn tasty!

Here's the original unaltered recipe (my alterations are below):

Arrange bread slices, staggering them, in a 12 - 14" long oval gratin dish
or a 4 C souffle dish.

In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, honey, sugar, vanilla and
brandy or Kahlua. Sift the cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt together
onto the egg mixture, then whisk until thoroughly combined (and your arm
will probably want to fall off at this point).

Pour the cocoa-egg mixture evenly over the bread slices and let stand
until all the bread is thoroughly saturated with the custard. Depending
upon the freshness of the bread (5) and the dish you choose, this could
take 1 - 2 hrs.

Bake the pudding in a 325 deg F oven for 40 - 60 min, until it is barely
firm to the touch but not dry and pulling away from the sides of the dish.
Serve warm or, alternatively, cover and chill thoroughly before serving.
170 calories, 2.7g fat (6)

1) I didn't have the right bread but I did have some Squaw bread in the
freezer so I dried it out in the over at a low temperature for about 1/2
an hour.

2) I didn't have eggs so I used egg sub.

2.5) Forgot this one. I didn't have any skim milk on hand so I used a can
of nonfat evaporated milk and added water to make 2.5 C.

3) I didn't have any honey so I used corn syrup (a little extra because
honey is so sweet).

4) You can use unsweetend Herschey's cocoa for it if you don't want to try
to locate dutch-process. Actually, dutch-processing just leaves more of
the fat in the cocoa.

5) I broke the bread up into pieces rather than leaving it in slices. I
figured that would help along the soaking process. I let it soak for 10-15
min.

6) Probably lots less fat without using real eggs. I estimate 3g from the
cocoa. At most only 1g or so per serving.

Instructions:

*NOTE:  The original recipe used 3 eggs...I used egg beaters and it was fine.

I did not make the topping of the confectioner's sugar and water (skim
milk).  It was just fine without it.

The cake turned out very moist even though it passed the knife test...I will
cook it an extra couple of minutes next time or reduce a bit of the liquids.

Preheat oven to 350 deg F.  Butter and flour 12 C bundt pan.  Combine first
5 ingredients.  Beat together granulated sugar, mayonnaise and eggs.  On low

  2             Sticks  Butter -- or margarine
  5                     Eggs -- beaten
                        reserve one egg for glaze
  12                oz  Chocolate Chips
  1                Bar  White Chocolate -- chopped up

Instructions:

Mix water and yeast in a superhuge bowl.  Add 3 cups flour and 1 cup sugar.  Stir with a fork and let rise a half hour in a warm place.

Meanwhile, in another bowl, measure in 5 c. of flour, salt, 1/2 c. sugar, and the cocoa.  Add margarine and cut in with a knife until mixture resembles coarse meal.  At the end of the half hour, add 4 beaten eggs to the yeast mixture and stir well.  (Mix will decrease in volume.)  Add flour-margarine mixture to yeast  mixture and work in bowl.  Add chocolate chips and white chocolate and work them in too.  If sticky, add up to two more cups of flour.  Knead well on floured board until smooth and elastic.  Put in oiled bowl and cover with towel.  Put in warm place and let rise 2 hours (or until doubled).  Punch down. Knead lightly for a minute or two.

Divide dough into parts.  I usually make 3 loaves (I like the size they fit on my baking pans well, so here is how I divide them:
Divide the dough into 3 parts. Set aside two.
Divide the remaining one into 4 equal parts.  Braid 3 of them together.
Take the fourth and divide it into 3 parts.  Braid those and lay them over the large braid. Repeat for the other two hunks of dough. (I hope that makes sense)

Once the loaves are braided, put them onto oiled pans.  Cover and let rise in a warm place as long as possible (3-5 hours is fine - the longer they rise, the lighter the loaves will be - but don't wait so long that you kill the yeast).  When they are done rising, brush the top with beaten egg and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.

Prep Time:   1:40

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
     1/2           Cup  nonfat margarine -- or ultra lowfat marg
  1                Cup  Sugar
     1/2           Cup  Brown Sugar
  2                     egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute -- or equiv

  1                Tsp  Baking Soda
     1/2           Tsp  Salt -- or substitute

Instructions:

I have tried both the Promise Fat Free and the Promise Ultra Low-Fat margarine with the following cookie recipe.  Both will work, but both have a tendency to burn faster than cookies made with butter.  The batter was more cooperative (i.e., it congealed better) with the low fat than with the fat free.  This recipe is adapted from a Hershey's Chewy Chocolate & Chip Cookies recipe that I saw somewhere.  By my reckoning it has less than a half a gram of fat per cookie if made with the Fat Free, and about a gram & a half if made with the Ultra Low-Fat.  I'm sure someone will correct me if I've overlooked something.

Heat oven to 350 deg F.  Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, & salt; set aside.  Beat margarine, sugar, & brown sugar until well blended. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.  Add in flour mixture.

The original recipe said to bake 9-11 min; I found I didn't want to leave them in longer than 6.5-7 min.  I got about 30 cookies from this quantity of batter.  Doubling the recipe yielded about 6 dozen cookies.

To me, the cookies are chewy and chocolaty, and sweet enough to satisfy cravings for goodies.  Let me know if you find holes in my fat counting technique.

     3/4             C  Sugar -- (2/3 C)
  1               Tbsp  Margarine -- (2 T applesauce)

Instructions:

(Annice's change in ingredients)

I make a cake very similar to Allyson's.  I use 2 T applesauce instead of
the oil, water instead of the milk, only 2/3 cup sugar in the cake part,
and 2/3 cup brown sugar (and no white sugar) in the topping part.  The cake
comes out rich tasting and delicious.
Annice

Mix well the first 7 ingredients and spread in a 9" square pan.
Mix and sprinkle on batter in pan.
Pour 1 1/2 cups boiling water on top.
Bake 35-40 minutes at 350F.
This will separate roughly into a layer of
cake and a layer of pudding.  The longer you
bake it, the less pudding you get, and more
of the cake part.

>From: Allyson Tripp <atripp@sfu.ca>
Here is one of my all time favorite dessert recipes,
back to when my mom made it for us when I was a kid.
I was quite pleased when I realized how little fat
was involved in the recipe.  I have cut down the
margarine in the recipe a bit, and, given that the
texture of the cake is not as important as the sauce
that goes with it, I would expect that you can substitute
applesauce rather effectively.

Recipe:      Chocolate Meringue Kisses

Prep Time:   0:54

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  3              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  instant coffee granules -- (or powder)
  4        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1              ounce  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
     1/4           cup  confectioner's sugar -- sifted
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Instructions:

   Set racks in center and upper positions of oven; preheat to 325
   degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum. In a
   greasefree mixing bowl, combine egg whites and coffee powder; let
   stand for 5 minutes. Pulverize cocoa powder and chocolate in a food
   processor for about 30 seconds, or until chocolate is ground to a fine
   powder. Stir (do not process) confectioners sugar, cornstarch and
   cinnamon into the chocolate and cocoa until evenly incorporated; set
   aside.

   With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the egg whites and coffee
   until frothy. Increase speed to high and beat until soft peaks start
   to form. Gradually add granulated sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a
   time, until all of the sugar is incorporated. Add vanilla. Beat until
   stiff and glossy, about 90 seconds. Fold in chocolate/cocoa mixture
   until evenly incorporated but not overmixed.
   Spoon batter into a piping bag fitted with a 1/2inchdiameter open star
   tip and pipe kisses about 1 inch in diameter on the prepared baking
   sheets (lined with parchment paper), spacing the kisses about 1 1/2
   inches apart. (Alternatively, drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls.)

   Bake for 14 to 18 minutes, switching the baking sheets halfway
   through; the cookies should be almost firm to the touch. (Bake all the
   cookies at once; the batter does not hold. For chewy cookies underbake
   slightly; for crispy, drier ones overbake slightly.) Remove sheets to
   cooling racks and let the cookies stand for a minute or two. Then
   slide parchment from the baking sheet to a flat surface and let the
   cookies stand until completely cooled. Carefully peel the cookies from
   the parchment. (Store in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
   Freeze for longer storage.)

   Yield: about 3 1/2 dozen cookies.

                        Crust:
  7             ounces  Graham Cracker Crumbs
  3                     egg whites
                        Filling:
  8                 oz  unsweetened chocolate

Cool.

To prepare filling:  Melt chocolate over low heat.  Put remaining

*Using the lowest fat tofu available will significantly reduce fat content.


P.S.  To all of you who will potentially flame me for the fat content and
use of chocolate in this recipe, please don't!!  While this is not low fat
to our standards, the original recipe has 800 calories, and 28 grams of
fat per serving... This is a very rich dessert, very chocolaty and
satisfying -- so much so that you could easily eat 1/2 serving (7.5 gs of
fat) and it would still be worth while. If anyone has a suggestion for
replacing the chocolate, I'll gladly test it out in my kitchen and report
the results.

Ingredients:
     1/3           cup  brown sugar -- packed
     1/4           cup  cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  cocoa powder
  1                cup  flour
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  skim milk -- at room temperature
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- melted
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/3           cups  coffee -- very hot
                        or very hot water

Instructions:


Serves 9
Preheat oven to 350. Coat an 8" square baking pan with nonstick cooking
spray.

Mix the brown sugar with 2 tbl cocoa with a fork until the mixture is
lump free (or pretty close; I couldn't get it totally lump free). Set
aside.

Whisk the flour with the remaining 1/4 cup cocoa, white sugar, baking
powder and salt. Set aside.

Beat milk, butter and vanilla with an electric mixer until smooth. If you
use cold milk, you'll never get it smooth. The melted butter congeals
when it hits the cold milk. But, it doesn't seem to make a huge
difference. Add the flour mixture and beat until well mixed.

Scrape the batter into the pan and sprinkle the top with the brown sugar
mixture. Pour the coffee or water over the water. Bake for 30 minutes or
until the top looks browned and firm. The bottom of the cake will stay
soft and puddinglike. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan and serve directly
from the pan. Store the cake in the pan in the refrigerator.

If you are a mocha lover, use the coffee. It is really good! This cake is
good warm. You can reheat it in the microwave.

Ingredients:
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  cocoa powder
  1                cup  Egg Beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
  1                jar  preserves -- seedless, sugarless
                        raspberry, cherry or apricot preserves -- 10 oz. jar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1                cup  flour

Instructions:

Combine sugar and cocoa with electric mixer.  Gradually add
egg substitutes and jar of preserves, beating on low until sugar is no longer grainy.

Add vanilla, almond extract, and salt.  Combine flour and baking soda.
Stir in with a flexible rubber spatula.  Do not overmix.

Bake in preheated 325-degree oven 30-35 minutes.  Brownies should be slightly
underbaked but not runny in the center.  Allow to cool and cut into 2x2"
squares.

TEST KITCHEN NOTES: Because of jam, these brownies are sticky to cut.  To re-
duce sticking, wet the knife between each cut or partially freeze the brownies
before cutting.  (Sal's note:  this is assuming you've been able to wait till
they were cool to cut them, rather than scooping some out with a spatula!)

These are supposed to be very moist and seem very sinful, but they're not!

Ingredients:
  1                box  Betty Crocker Lite Devil's Food cake mix
                        Sliced fresh strawberries -- enough to cover top
                        of cake (about 1 pint?)
     3/4           cup  fatfree strawberry yogurt -- (3/4 to 1)
                        (I wouldn't use one with gelatin in it)
  1 1/2           cups  Lite whipped topping -- (1 1/2 to 2)

Instructions:

Make the cake according to directions (you can use either 9x13 pan or two
round cake pans, although it's a little tricky getting the layers to stay
even).  Cook cake and top with sliced strawberries.  Fold yogurt and
whipped topping together and spread over strawberries.  If you make a
layer cake, this is enough to do the middle and top, but not the sides.
Chill cake a couple of hours before serving.

If you want a different flavor, you could use a different flavor of yogurt.
Blueberries on a yellow cake would be good. [Jenny]

  4             ounces  Light cream cheese
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  3        tablespoons  Cocoa powder -- unsweetened
  2              large  Egg whites

  3        tablespoons  Bailey's Irish Cream -- (light)
  1         tablespoon  Coffee liqueur
                        TOPPING:

  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  Honey

Instructions:

  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

  Coat a 10-inch glass pie plate with 3 sprays of the vegetable oil.

  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tofu, ricotta cheese, cream
  cheese, maple syrup, cocoa powder, egg whites, cinnamon, and the liqueurs.
  Puree until smooth and pour into the prepared pie plate.

  Place the pie plate on the center rack of the oven.  On the bottom rack,
  place a baking pan filled halfway with water.  Bake for 1 hour.

  While the cake is baking, combine all the topping ingredients in a small
  bowl and whisk thoroughly.

  When the cake has cooked for an hour, remove it from the oven, spread the
  topping on evenly, decorate if you wish, and return it to the oven.  Bake
  for about 10 minutes more, until the topping sets.

  Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.  Decorate with the Chocolate Sauce
  Design if you wish.

  Making a Chocolate Sauce Design:  Put a mixture of 2 tablespoons pure
  maple syrup and 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder into a squeeze
  bottle or an improvised pastry bag, which can be made by forcing the sauce
  into a bottom corner of a sturdy plastic storage bag and pricking a small
  hole throught which it can flow.  Squeeze a series of straight lines
  across the cake, then rake the tines of a fork across the top in the
  opposite direction to create a pattern.

  fluffy. Beat in chocolate. One at a time, beat in egg, then whites,
  coffee and vanilla until smoothly incorporated. Gently stir half of
  the dry ingredients, then yogurt into the mixture just until mixed.
  Stir in remaining dry ingredients just until well blended and smooth.
  Divide batter among pans, spreading in edges.

  Bake in the middle of the oven for 23-28 minutes, or until tops are
  almost firm when tapped and a toothpick inserted in the center comes
  out moist but clean. Transfer pans to racks and let stand until
  completely cooled. Layers may be wrapped airtight and frozen for
  later use. Let return to room temperature before using. Or frost cake
  and serve immediately, if desired. Makes 10-12 servings.

  Nutritional information (with fluffy chocolate frosting): Each serving
  contains 342 calories, 10 grams of fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, 25
  milligrams of cholesterol, 202 milligrams of sodium. Percentage of
  calories from fat: 26.

  FLUFFY CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Place egg whites in a large mixer bowl.
  Set the bowl in a large bowl of very hot tap water and let stand for
  10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small heavy saucepan set over
  low heat, melt chocolate, stirring constantly, until smooth; be very
  careful not to scorch. Set aside to cool slightly.

  Combine the corn syrup, 1/4 cup water and the sugar in a 2-quarter
  saucepan, stirring until well blended. Bring to a simmer over
  medium-heat heat. Cover and boil for 2 minutes to allow steam to wash
  any sugar from pan sides. Uncover and continue simmering, without
  stirring, until mixture bubbles loudly and reaches 244-245'F on a
  candy thermometer (about 1 1/2 minutes). (To test without a candy
  thermometer, drop a teaspoon of syrup into ice water; when cooked to
  the proper temperature the syrup will form a firm ball that holds its
  shape when squeezed.) Immedately remove pan from heat and set aside.

  With mixer set on medium speed, beat egg whites until very frothy and
  opaque. Raise speed to high and beat until whites just begin to stand
  in soft peaks; be careful not to overbeat. Meanwhile, return syrup to
  burner and reheat just to boiling. Beating whites on high speed,
  immediately begin pouring boiling syrup in a stream down the side of
  the bowl (avoid beaters or syrup will stick to them or be thrown onto
  bowl side), pouring rapidly enough that all the syrup is incorporated
  in about 15 seconds. Add salt and continue beating on high speed
  until the mixture is stiffened, glossy and cooled to barely warm.
  Beat in vanilla and coffee mixture until evenly incorporated. Sift
  powdered sugar and cocoa onto a sheet of wax paper. A bit at a time,
  whisk into egg-white mixture. Whisk in melted chocolate just until
  smoothly incorporated.

  Frost cake immediately, or store frosting airtight for up to 48 hours.
  Frosting may soften and gradually deflate upon longer standing.

             Vegan
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  8                 oz  chestnuts -- peeled
  3                 oz  sugar
  4        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  rum -- brandy or other
                        spirit
                        Icing sugar as needed

Instructions:

Simmer chestnuts in water until cooked - about 5-10 minutes.  Meanwhile
boil the sugar and water until a drop sets instantly on contact with
cold water - if you do this too early you end up with a mass of sugar
and water which you can't get out of the saucepan, so have everything
else ready first.

Put chestnuts, cocoa powder and the sugar syrup into the food processor
and blend.  Add spirit as liked (I said 2 tbls, but you could use less or
more), or perhaps a little coffee essence...  If it is a bit runny, add
some icing sugar.

Then make into truffle-sized balls and roll in cocoa powder or mouse
droppings (sorry, I mean chocolate vermicelli - sprinkles, in American
usage, I think), and store in the fridge.

thickness of wax paper and place a string tightly around the outside of the
bowl. Place in a pot of boing water.(fill up to neck of bowl) Boil for three
hours. Makes 2 bowls.

This recipe freezes well. When serving this you will want to steam it again
so it is heated through. My mom served it with a brown sugar and butter
mixture on the side, she just mixed the two together. Or you can choose to
make the Carrot Pudding Sauce (see recipe).

Ingredients:
  8             ounces  fresh wholemeal breadcrumbs -- (4 loosely packed
                        cups)
  2               cups  black raisins -- coarsely chopped
                        (Muscatel)
  2               cups  yellow raisins -- coarsley chopped
                        (sultanas)

     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves

  2        tablespoons  orange marmalade -- or candied orange
                        peel
  1                     orange -- juiced
  4             medium  eggs
  6               tbsp  Cognac -- or 1 miniature
                        bottle fortified muscat wine
                        or port or marsala
                        or rich oloroso sherry

Instructions:

Serves 8-10, fills a 1.75-litre (3-pint) pudding basin

(I used whole cloves, and put them in the food processor
with the bread!  Again, it worked)

Put all the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly.  Put the
marmalade, orange juice, eggs, brandy and wine in another large bowl, or
in the blender or food processor, and beat until well blended and frothy.
Pour the liquid over the dry ingredients.  Mix until moist. Cover, and
let sand for a couple of hours at least and, if possible, overnight to
let the spice flavours develop.

Oil or butter the pudding basin and spoon in the mixture.  As it contains
no raw flour, it will not expand very much during the cooking, so you
can fill the basin to within 1.25 cm (1/2 inch) of the rim.  Take a
square of greaseproof or waxed paper, oil or butter it (I didn't bother,
but did oil the basins.  I don't have a 3-pint one, so used 1 2-pint and
1 1-pint one, 2 pints being ample for my family for Christmas dinner) and
tie it over the top of the basin with string.

Steam in boiling water for 5 hours.  Allow pudding to cool completely
before wrapping it, still in its basin, in fresh greaseproof paper plus
a layer of foil.  Store in a cool dark place.

On Christmas Day, steam for a further two hours.

Bissell/Levy suggest serving this with creme fraiche, rather than the
traditional brandy butter (don't ask - not to be discussed on THIS
mailing list!!!), and I do think this is one occasion when a LITTLE
cream is permissible!

Incidentally, the tradition is that every member of the family stirs
the pudding mixture while making a wish....

Ingredients:
  1                     Onion -- chopped
  2                     Garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/4           cup  Water
  1                can  tomatoes -- (28 oz) crushed
  1                can  Green chiles -- chopped (can)
  3        tablespoons  Chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  Ground cumin
  1 1/2           cups  Water
  1         tablespoon  Soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  Cornstarch -- (or 2 T Arrowroot)

Instructions:

Place the onion, garlic, and water in a large saucepan. Cook,
stirring for 5 minutes, until the onion softens slightly. Add the
tomatoes, chilies, and the spices.  Stir.  Cover and cook over low
heat for 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the water and the soy sauce.
Mix the cornstarch in the remaining 1/2 cup water.
Add to the sauce while stirring.  Cook stirring, until thickened.

 From "The Mcdougall Cookbook" by you-know-who!  Makes about 6 cups.

Ann's notes:  I increase the cumin and add a T. or so of cocoa
powder for a "mole" influence.  This is a very nice recipe (pretty
zingy for a MacDougall recipe).  If you substitute tomato sauce for
the crushed tomatoes, you'll get a smoother sauce.

Instructions:

NOTE: (I only had about 1/3 c. honey on hand so I added
some light corn syrup.  You could also add maple syrup and get some added
flavor.)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Stir until thoroughly coated.  Press mixture firmly into 2 well greased
10x15 cookie sheets.  (I used 9x13 pans)  Bake 10-15 minutes until nicely
browned.  Cut immediately into 24 bars.  Remove from pans when cool.

If I calculated correctly each bar has about 130 calories and 4 grams Fat.

  1                cup  Hot water -- or up to:
  2               cups  Hot water -- * see note
  1           teaspoon  Vanilla

Instructions:

* Note: More water makes the granola chunkier, less makes it crumbly.

 Preheat oven to 350 F.  In a large bowl or pot, combine oats, nuts,
seeds, millet, flour, and salt.
Mix together honey, water, and vanilla, and stir into dry ingredients.
Spread on a lightly oiled baking sheet and squeeze mixture together to
form small chunks, but don't crowd; the chunks need to bake clear
through.  Roast until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes.
(With the larger amount of water, reduce heat and bake longer.)  As it
bakes the granola may need stirring to brown evenly.  Cool thoroughly
before storing.

 Variations:  Replace part of the water with the freshly squeezed juice
of 2 oranges (and add the grated rinds if the oranges were not sprayed
with pesticides), or use 2 teaspoons orange oil.

 For "gingerbread" granola, use half molasses (for half honey) and add 2
teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.

 For a nice change, substitute maple syrup for honey.

Ingredients:

  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  lean beef -- **(see directions)
     1/4             c  all-purpose flour
     1/4             t  salt
  1              Pinch  pepper
  2                  T  oil

     1/4             t  cumin
  1                     bay leaf
                        PUMPKIN:
  1                     pumpkin -- about 6 lb
  2                  T  melted butter
  1              pinch  salt and pepper
                        TOPPING:
  1 1/2              c  yogurt
     1/2             c  green onions -- chopped

Instructions:

In heavy saucepan, cook onions & garlic in a little water, broth, or
wine for 5 minutes, or until onions are limp.  Remove from saucepan;
set aside.

Cut beef into 1-inch [2.5 cm] cubes.  Combine flour, salt & pepper in
sturdy plastic bag.  Add meat, a few pieces at a time; shake until
lightly coated with flour.

In saucepan, warm oil over high heat.  Add meat a layer at a time; cook
until browned all over.  Remove with slotted spoon.  Return onions,
garlic, & meat to saucepan; stir in undrained tomatoes, currants, cumin,
cinnamon, cloves, & bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, covered; reduce heat to
low and simmer until meat is tender, about 1-1/2 hours.  Stir frequently
and uncover, if necessary, in the last 20 minutes to thicken gravy.

PUMPKIN:  Meanwhile, prepare pumpkin.  Wash pumpkin; cut out 4-inch [10
cm] lid.  Using large spoon, scoop out seeds and scrape away any stringy
flesh.  Brush inside of pumpkin with butter, and sprinkle with salt and
pepper.  Place pumpkin & lid on heatproof serving tray (casserole dish?)
Bake at 425 deg F [220 deg C] for 25 minutes.

Taste stew and adjust seasoning, if necessary.  Carefully ladle stew
into pumpkin; cover with lid and return to oven for about 45 minutes or
just until inside of pumpkin is tender.

Just before serving, combine yogurt and onions.  Carry pumpkin to table.
With large spoon, serve stew and portion of pumpkin with yogurt mixture
spooned over.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

**To lower fat: Don't use the beef.  Substitute a combination of
  vegetables, potatoes and/or rice.  A good combination might be corn,
  potatoes, cauliflower, and turnips/rootabaga.  TVP may be good, too,
  if seasoning is increased.  Also, the pumpkin doesn't need to be
  brushed with butter, and non-fat yogurt will help, too.
  If the meat *is* used, don't flour and then brown in oil.  Stir 'fry'
  meat in a small amount of water, broth, or wine; then stir the flour
  into the 'drippings' (add more liquid, if necessary) before you re-add
  the onions, garlic, meat, etc. to the pan.

Sweet Potato Pie (Kai's)

Mira L. Shanks (Kai)

2 cups cooked mashed sweet potatoes
1 1/4 cup egg substitute
 or 5 egg whites, slightly beaten
1 cup brown sugar,(granulated)
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup evaporated skim milk
Phyllo Pie Crust:
4 tsp. sugar (optional)
1 box Phyllo dough
Optional Topping:
1 cup chopped roasted chestnuts (optional)
Cinnamon

Preheat oven to 425.  Lightly spray 2 pie pans with nonstick cooking spray.

FILLING:
I used a pressure cooker to cook the sweet potatoes until very soft  and not
stringy or slow bake (appx.350 for 50 minutes,until sweet potatoes natural
sugar oozes out) on a previous night for enhanced flavor & natural
sweetness.

Mash very well.  (I used a regular mixer)

Combine sugar, spices in a little bowl. Last add vanilla with the spices and
then mix into the potatoes.
Now , beat your egg whites and mix it in with the potato mixture.
Slowly mix in your evaporated skim milk and set aside.

CRUST
I took out the entire stack of phyllo sheets from the box.  Turned my pie
pans over and cut the entire stack to the appx. circumference of the pan so
I had a stack of circular dough.

Quickly, (dough dries out very fast and sticks together) layer 1 or 2 sheets
of phyllo on each of the pans, spray very LIGHTLY with non-stick cooking
spray and sprinkle with sugar and repeat until crust is the thickness you
desire.  (For 2 pies I used all the phyllo dough in the box)
I moistened my fingers to seal the edge of the crust and crimp as with a
"normal" crust.
Cover edges of crust loosely with foil.

Pour filling into the phyllo crust.   Sprinkle chopped chestnuts and
cinnamon on top if desired.

Bake for 15 minutes at 425. Reduce temperature to 350 and bake for about 30
minutes
more.

Recipe using  the recipe makeover techniques from Shape Magazine's VLF

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        Crisp:
  1 3/4            cup  flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
     1/4           cup  oats

     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1                tsp  cinnamon
                        Butter spray
                        --or 1T lowfat margarine -- cut in pieces
                        -- (Orig: 1 cup lf margarine) -- cut in pieces
                        Filling:
  3 1/2            lbs  apples
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2                tsp  lemon rind
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  flour
     1/2           cup  cranberries -- dried
                        Cinnamon -- optional

Instructions:

Preheat oven at 375 degrees

Combine first six ingredients until coarse in texture. (Original recipe: mix in lf margarine, too.)
Put aside.

Slice apples and combine with remaining five ingredients. Place apple
mixture in buttered 13" x 9" glass pan. Top with meal mixture and pat
it down firmly and evenly. (Spray with butter spray or dot with lf margarine if using the reduced fat version.)
Bake for about 45-60 min.
Topping should be medium brown--if it gets too dark before 45 min, cover
with foil and finish baking.
Cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting into loose squares. Makes
12 servings.

Try peaches and berries.

Tips: If a thin metal pan is used, apples can get overcooked and mushy.
Check tenderness of apples at 45 min. If they're very tender and topping
needs more cooking, you can broil the topping for 1-2 minutes and remove
from the oven.

Categories:  Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Information, Tips, Misc.

Ingredients:
                        ****

Instructions:

I've found that most of the fat in cinnamon rolls comes from the butter you
put in the middle, and from the icing.  This is pretty easy to reduce.  I
sometimes make them from scratch, but I've also been known to use Pillsbury
Roll dough mix, and add a little sugar (about 1/4 cp) to the mix.  Roll them
out, and brush the dough with margarine, instead of laying butter pats in it.
Also, use a mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar in the middle, as it makes them
a little more caramelly.  The dough itself is not high in fat.  For icing,
use powdered sugar, a few drops of skim milk, a few drops of vanilla, and
a teaspoon or 2 of light cream cheese-whisk it together and spread over
warm baked rolls.  YOu can also omit most of the butter in the roll recipe,
but they won't keep as long (you can freeze them).

  2                tsp  Canola Oil -- * NOTE, or
                        Safflower Oil
  1                tsp  Unsalted Butter -- **NOTE,

  1                  C  Apple Cider -- or apple juice
     1/2             C  Molasses -- unsulfured

Instructions:

*NOTE:   Original recipe called for 2 T canola oil.  I used 2 tsp.
**NOTE:  Original recipe called for 2 T unsalted butter - I used 1 tsp.
Also see Light Touch)
***NOTE:  Original recipe called for 1 large egg - I used egg beaters.

[I have made this cake several times (many during the holidays), and I'm
pretty sure I substituted Applesauce for most or all of the oil.  You had
it down to about 3 tsp of oil/solid fat, and I think I used 2 TB of applesauce
and left out the oil and margarine completely.  This cake still keeps well,
because it has molasses etc. to keep it moist.  Even my sister, who regularly
poo poo's my lowfat efforts (which are generally quite good IMHO) had to
ask for the recipe!
nf]

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 350 deg F.
Generously coat the baking pan with cooking spray.  Dust with flour, and tap
out excess flour.  (Be sure to grease and flour the pan very thoroughtly so
the cranberries do not stick.)

Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt onto a sheet of wax
paper or into a bowl.  Combine about 3 T of the flour mixture with the
cranberries in another bowl, and toss well.  Set aside.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the sugar, oil and
butter until well blended.  Add the egg and beat well.

In a small saucepan, bring the cider or apple juice to a boil.  Remove from
the heat and add the molasses, stirring until it dissolves.

With the mixer on very low speed, alternately add the dry ingredients and
the molasses mixture to the beaten sugar-egg mixture, beginning and ending
with the dry ingredients.  Stir in the cranberries.  The batter will be
quite thin.

Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake for 45 - 50 min. or until the
top is springy to the touch and a cake tester insterted in the center comes
out clean.  Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 15 min, then invert
onto another rack and let cool.

LIGHT TOUCH:
The texture of this rich, moist cake really varies depending upon the type
of fat used.   have tried making it with all oil, but fin it is appreciably
better with a small amount of solid fat.  My personal preference is for th
butter-oil combination, which weighs in with 20 percent of its total
calories from fat.  To reduce the calories from fat to 18 percent,
substitute 4 T hard stick corn oil margarine for the butter and oil; this
cuts 4 calories, 1 g fat and 0.7 g saturated fat from each serving.

Yield:  4 C batter; one 9" bundt cake; 12 servings
Advance Preparation:
Cake is best when fresh from the oven, but it may be made in advance,
wrapped airtight, and frozen.  Thaw and warm before serving.

Special Equip:
9" bundt pan preferably nonstick.

Time an Temp:
350 deg F for 45 - 50 min.  (I ended up cooking it for 35 min and it was a
bit over done I feel - Reggie)

             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  6                     egg whites
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1                cup  sugar -- (or less)
  2               cups  flour -- (combo of grains)
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- (or less)
     3/4           cup  raisins

Instructions:

Beat eggwhites and extracts together well.  Combine all the dry ingred
and add to the egg and mix well.  Fold in the raisins.  The dough
should be firm, but not too stiff.  You may need to add as much as
1/4c more flour if your egg whites were large.  Divide the dough in
half and shape each into a 'log' about 2: wide and 10'12" log.  Place
each on a greased cooked sheet and bake in a preheated oven a 325 F or
25-30 min.  They should be firm to the touch, but not too brown.
Remove from the oven and turn down the temp to 250F.  Slice each log
into 20-24 pieces and place upright (if you can balance them!) on the
cookie sheets.  Return to the oven for about 30-40 min.  The thicker
the slices, the longer it takes.  Cool them completely before storing
them in an airtight container.

Make sure you dunk these.

Instructions:

(Revised)
This stuff makes the most fantastic toast.  It's also not bad
untoasted.  We have made it successfully making the bread as listed,
but adding only 1 Tbsp of white sugar and no cinnamon at the beginning,
and then adding a cinnamon/brown sugar mixture 30 s. or a minute before
the end of the last kneading cycle.  The sugar/cinnamon ends up marbled
through the bread, and it is wonderful  (hard to get right though)

     1/2           cup  boiling water -- or broth
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- optional
     1/8      teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1              whole  egg -- beaten
                        Dough:
  3               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus addt'l for
                        --  kneading
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- optional
  1                cup  water
  1              whole  egg
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Instructions:

1. Prepare the potato filling by combining the mashed potatoes,
sauteed onions, matzo meal or bread crumbs, melted butter/margarine
or oil, beaten egg, salt and pepper. Set aside.

2. Prepare kasha or bulgar filling by adding to the sauteed onion
the uncooked kasha or bulgar, boiling water or broth, salt and pepper
in a medium saucepan. Cover the pan and cook for 10-15 minutes or until
the liquid is absorbed. Stir in the egg. Set aside.

3. Prepare the dough by combining the flour, baking powder, and the
salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the water, egg and
oil and add this mixture to the flour mixture, stirring the ingredients
until they are well combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface,
and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes,
adding only enough flour to keep the dough from sticking. Cover the
dough with an inverted bowl and let it rest for 5 minutes. Cut the dough
in half, and on a lightly floured surface roll each half into a rectangle
about 20x10 inches. Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise. You will end
up with 4 strips, each 20x5 inches.

4. Using half the potato filling, align the mixture in a strip along the
20 inch side of the dough. Roll the dough up toward the other 20 inch
side.
With a very sharp knife, slice the roll into 1 inch pieces. Repeat with
remaining filling.

5. Place the pieces about 1/2 inch apart, seam side down on greased
cookie sheets.

6. Bake the knishes in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25-30 minutes or
until the crust is browned.

Note: You can make big knishes if you want to serve them as a side dish.
      This is a pretty involved messy process but I think it's well worth
      the effort every now and then.

                        nonfat yogurt

Instructions:

Coleslaw is basically shredded white cabbage, carrot and onion, in
proportions you find agreeable.  I would dress this with a mixture of
50:50 reduced calorie mayonnaise and natural yogurt.  If it's not for
me, I use all mayonnaise - we can't get fat-free mayonnaise here, but
the reduced calorie stuff is excellent, almost nicer than the real
thing.

Anyway, the coleslaw always goes at parties!  I use one medium white
cabbage, about 1/2 lb carrots, and one onion, and do all the shredding,
etc, in the food processor.

Instructions:

I took another poster's recipe Kale and Tomatoes (sorry I forgot who
posted it) and changed the kale to collards.  It is excellent.

Rinse torn leaves and do not shake or dry them.  Put in pot/pan and wilt.
Add Italian seasoning, chopped tomatoes and continue to heat about 5 min.
Add as much of the liquid as you want (a lot makes it into a soup, a
little bit makes it into a side dish).  Heat about 2 - 3 more min or until
hot and serve.

This serves 1 person.

First, heat the oil in a heavy pan and then add the onion. Saute until
     it is transparent and then add the garlic and cook that also. Next put
     in the curry powder, ground cloves, the chopped tomatoes, sultanas and
     sugar. Sprinkle the lemon juice over. Cover, and cook very gently for
     30-40 minutes or until pumpkin is tender, stirring frequently to
     ensure that it does not catch. Season and serve to accompany main
     dishes and rice.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  3 1/2           cups  bread flour -- General Mills
                        "Better for Bread"
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
     1/2           cup  honey
  1 1/2           cups  water
  3        tablespoons  butter -- margarine will
                        work, but not as well
     1/4           tsp  salt
  2        tablespoons  yeast -- I prefer Red Star

Instructions:

Dissolve honey and water.  The warmer they are, the easier they'll
mix.  Add the yeast, whisk it all together, and set aside.

Blend the flours and salt, and melt the butter in a separate dish.
Once melted, add the butter to the yeast/honey/water mixture.  Whisk
together.

Add liquid to dry ingredients and knead down on a floured board.  You
could also mix the ingredients with a Kitehcn-Aid mixer (dough hook
attachment), then transfer to a floured board.  When finished, the
dough should be very soft, but not too sticky.  Let rise until
doubled.

Punch down, knead on a floured board, and divide into two loaves.
Shape into cylinders, or round balls, or whatever shape you prefer.
Let rise until 2 to 2 1/2 times original size.  Score if desired, or
glaze with one beaten egg.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.

This bread works best when cooked with stoneware.

Ingredients:
  1           teaspoon  vodka
  8             ounces  oil

Instructions:

I read somewhere that if you added 1 teaspoon of vodka to the olive oil in the
spray container (one about 8 oz. size) that the oil will spray much more easily.
I have tried it and it does work!!!! However, some olive oils seem to be more
viscous than others, so you may want to start with one of the lighter ones first
and work your way up to a really thick and wonderful extra virgin type.

Recipe:      Cooking With Garlic

Instructions:

A Guide to Cooking with Garlic

For the best flavor, crush garlic before chopping and mincing to release
its aromatic oils.  First trim off the stem end.  Set the clove on a work
surface; place the broad side of the knife blade directly on the garlic
and press down on the blade with the heel of your hand to crush the clove.
 The outer peel will slip off; discard it.  Then chop or mince the garlic.

Raw Pressed Garlic:
Full garlic power.  Some cooks won't use a garlic press, claiming it
breaks down the garlic too much, making the essential oils too strong and
unsavory.   Use raw pressed garlic in dressings and pastas only when you
want this full, full flavor.

Raw Chopped Or Minced Garlic:
Best strong flavor.  Add raw chopped or minced garlic to salsas, sauces
and spreads, or combine with parsley, lemon zest, salt and pepper to
sprinkle over pasta, rice or eggs.

Raw Whole Cloves:
Mildest raw form.   Use raw whole cloves when you want just a hint of
garlic flavor.  Drop cloves into marinades and salad dressings.  Spear
them with the fork you use to beat eggs for scrambles, omlets and quiche.
For a little more oomph, cut the clove in half and run it along the inside
of your salad bowl.

Sauteed Chopped or Minced Garlic:
Strongest of the cooked garlic flavors.  (Minced garlic is slightly
stronger than chopped.)  Enlivens dishes with a full garlic flavor but
none of the pungency of the raw clove.  Cook garlic in a little oil,
butter, wine or stock at the beginning of a variety of recipes, from
spaghetti and  meatballs to coq au vin.

Sauteed or Simmered Whole Garlic Cloves:
For a delicate hint of mild garlic flavor, saute whole cloves briefly in
the oil you use to cook vegetables and meats.  Discard the garlic before
adding other ingredients.  Simmer whole cloves with potatoes, greens or
beets and remove the garlic before serving.  Use whole cloves in stocks
and soups - unpeeled for an even lighter touch.

Roasted Whole Garlic Cloves:
These offer a wonderful caramel flavor.  Add whole cloves - skin on or off
- to roasting vegetables or meats.  To serve, pop unpeeled cloves out of
their skin and enjoy the sweet garlic with the rest of the roast.

Baked Head of Garlic:
The sweetest, most mild flavor; almost buttery.  No appetizer could be
simpler.  Remove any loose outer peel from a head of garlic and trim the
top to expose just a bit of the cloves in side.  Rub the garlic head with
a little olive oil, drizzling a bit over the tops of the cloves.  Enclose
it in an earthenware garlic baker or foil and bake it at 350 deg F until
soft, about 45 min.  Separate the cloves, squeeze the garlic out of the
peel and spread it with a knife onto crusty bread.

Ingredients:
  1                     reduced fat graham cracker crust
  1                tub  Cool Whip Lite(r) -- (8 oz)  or any other
                        lite whipped topping in a tub
  1          small box  jello -- your favorite
                        flavor-we used lime
                        fruit for decoration -- we used a kiwi

Instructions:

Make jello (4 serving size) according to quick jelling package directions-
usually requires dissolving jello in 1/2 cp boiling water, and then adding
1/2 cp cold water and 3/4 cp icecubes.  Stir until jello starts to thicken, and
then remove icecubes.  Stir in cool whip, and put in fridge or freezer for 10
minutes, until mixture will mound.  Pour into pie crust, and decorate lightly
with fruit slices.  This is incredibly good, and not to sinful with light
cool whip and reduced fat crust.  I believe a similar dessert can also be
made with pudding instead of jello-prepare pudding per package directions,
chill until partly set, and mix in cool whip.

                        Oranges -- (1 to 1 1/2 oranges
                        per person)
                        Orange Flower Water
                        Cinnamon
                        Icing Sugar
                        Orange Flavoured Fat-free yoghurt -- (or any flavour)

Instructions:

Peel and segment the oranges and arrange the segments
like flower petals on individual plates.
Sprinkle the oranges with Orange Flower Water	cover with plastic
wrap and put	in	the refrigerator.  I will usually do this
the night before to give the Orange Flower Water plenty of
time soak into	the orange segments	but a couple of
hours should be okay	as well.  Just before you are ready to	take the
serve dessert	plates out of the fridge	remove the plastic
wrap and sprinkle	a little more Orange Flower water over the
segments.  Next	sprinkle on some icing sugar and cinnamon.
Spoon a large	dollop of yoghurt into the centre	and serve.

The Orange Flower water gives this a very light, delicate
flavour, and the scent is just heavenly.  This is really
refreshing on those hot summer days.

  2                  C  Evaporated Skim Milk
  2               Tbsp  Cornstarch

Instructions:

Saw the request for lf Corn Chowder.  Here is one that looks good from
Tribole's Healthy Homestyle Cooking.  Haven't tried it yet.

In a blender or food processor, blend or process 1/2 cup of the corn and 1/4
cup of the broth until smooth. Set the corn mixture aside.  Lightly spray an
unheated medium saucepan with no-stick spray.  Add the potatoes, celery,
green peppers and onions.  Cook and stir over medium heat until the onions
are tender.  Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup broth.  Bring to a boil, reduce
the heat.  Cover and simmer about 10 minutes or until the potatoes are
tender.  Using the back of a fork, slightly mash the potatoes against the
side of the saucepan.  In a custard cup, stir together 2 tablespoons of the
milk and the cornstarch until smooth.  Then stir the cornstarch mixture into
the corn mixture.  Add the remaining milk and the remaining 1 1/4 cups corn.
 Cook and stir until bubbly and thickened,  Cook and stir for 2 minutes
more.
***Note:  This is where the directions for the recipe end.  It sounds as if
a step is left off.  I assume you are supposed to stir the corn and
cornstarch mixture into the pot with the vegetables, and then proceed as
directed.

  1                  C  Whole-Wheat Flour -- or white flour
  1                  C  Cornmeal -- stone-ground

     1/2           cup  Skim Milk -- or skim
  3                     Egg Whites -- lightly beaten

Instructions:

Here is my own recipe for corn bread .  It has no added fat, though the
individual ingredients do have small amounts of unavoidable fat.

Preheat the oven to 400F.  Stir the dry ingredients together.  Whisk the
wet ingredients.  Stir the wets into the drys, allowing a few lumps to
remain in the mixture.  Pour into a 8 x 8 inch pan sprayed with Pam or
some other such thing.  Bake for 20-25 minutes (check after 15--you don't
want it to get too dry).

Notes:  You can bake the mixture in muffin tins for muffins.  This recipe
seems like it has a lot of liquid.  Don't worry:  the bread comes out with
kind of a custardy moist texture.[Toni]

  2        tablespoons  bread crumbs -- fine, toasted
                        For the budin:
  2               cups  Corn kernels -- *
     1/2           cup  Milk
  5        tablespoons  Unsalted butter

  1           teaspoon  Sugar
  1           teaspoon  Sea salt -- or to taste

Instructions:

  Heat the oven to 300 F.  Place a heavy baking sheet on the lower rack
  of the oven.  Butter a 1-quart baking or souffle dish and sprinkle
  with the bread crumbs.  Set aside.

  Put the corn and milk into a food processor and process for 10 to 15
  seconds or until reduced to a textured puree.  Beat the butter until
  creamy and gradually add the corn and the eggs, one by one, beating
  after each addition.  Add the sugar and salt.

  Pour the mixture into the prepared dish and bake until the mixture is
  firmly set and beginning to brown around the edges - about 35 minutes.

  Either serve from the dish or carefully unmold onto a serving dish.

  * Starchy field corn works best, ears of corn left intact that have
  been picked a few days earlier, for the starches to heighten, can be
  used.

Ingredients:
  2               cups  masa harina
  1 1/2           cups  salsa -- fresh, puree

Instructions:

Put masa  harina in a bowl and mix in the pureed salsa with a wooden
spoon. Form  dough into 12 pieces (balls) . Form tortillas by hand or a
tortilla press. Also by using a rolling pin to flatten the ball of dough
between two sheets of plastic wrap. Place tortilla onto a
very hot ungreased griddle or skillet. Cook for 30 seconds on each side.
The edges of the tortillas will brown and lift when they are ready to turn
to the other side. The salsa tortillas are great.

If the dough is to dry just add more liquid or if it is to wet just add
more masa. This dough is very hardy, you can't hurt it.

You can use most any liquid to add to the masa as long as it is the equal
amount the recipe calls for.



Tortillas can be frozen. They also keep well in the refridgerator.

Makes 12 tortillas.

  1         Tablespoon  molasses -- optional

Instructions:

* ( I just nuke an apple and mush it with the braun)

Preheat over to 425 degrees farenheit. Spray a skillet (cast iron) or I
use a medium size Visions pot or any other kind of casserole dish, with
pam or lightly oil and set the pan into the oven to preheat.

Mix all the dry stuff together and add the wet stuff. Mix well but don't
beat it to death. Pull out the hot pan, pour the batter in and bake for
20 minutes.

Recipe:      Cornflour Pudding (Chocolate)

Prep Time:   1:05
Categories:  Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegetables
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  2 1/2           cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  corn flour -- or semolina
  2        tablespoons  cocoa
  1         tablespoon  demerara sugar -- (up to 2T)

Instructions:

They are all the same basic method - you have about 2 oz cereal to 1 pint
of milk (500 ml - 2.5 US cups), and the same amount of sugar.  You mix
the cereal & sugar with 2 tbs of the milk, while you are boiling the
rest of the milk.  Pour the boiling milk over the cereal mix, stirring
all the time, and bring back to the boil, also stirring all the time.

If you use a little more cornflour and some flavouring, it sets to a
jelly-like consistency and becomes blanc-mange - chocolate is particularly
good.  I use only 2 tablespoons cornflour, 1 tbs cocoa powder, and 1-2
tbs demerara sugar, and call the result "Thames mud!"  Yummy.  Skimmed
or semi-skimmed milk means the pudding is low in fat.

cut potato in 1/2 and in 1/2 again then slice
spray fry pan w/pam
add sliced potato & spread out evenly in fry pan
let brown then "stir fry" until all the potatoes are evenly browned & crisp (I like mine crispy so I'll put a cover on the pan to "steam" the potatoes & make sure they're cooked through - stirring them several times before I do the final browning)

                        eggs

  16            ounces  frozen corn kernels
  6             ounces  lowfat cheddar cheese -- shredded

Instructions:

Vegetarians will find this
dish filling enough to be the centerpiece of a meal.  Before I "converted" I
used to serve it with ham or BBQ chicken - it goes very well with "sweetish"
type meats.  Don't let the name fool you, it's much more like a quiche than a
souffle. [AuburnQT@aol.com]

Combine evaporated milk and egg substitute and mix well.  Add flour, sugar
and spices, beat with a wire wisk until combined.  Fold in corn kernals and
cheddar cheese.  Pour into 9x13 baking dish coated with non-stick cooking
spray.  Bake uncovered at 350 F for 50 - 55 minutes or until a knife inserted
off-center comes out clean.  Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting into
squares to serve.  Serves 8 - 10.

Variation:  Omit sugar and nutmeg, add one 4 oz. can chopped mild green
chiles, drained.

  4              small  zucchini -- courgettes (4 to 5)
  3             slices  whole wheat bread -- (wholemeal )
  3             ounces  lowfat cheddar cheese -- grated (3 to 5)

     1/2           cup  lowfat 1% milk
                        Salt and Pepper to taste

Instructions:

Cook rice in the normal way.  Slice courgettes very thinly.  You can saute
them briefly in a non-stick pan with perhaps some cooking spray, but I don't
bother.  Drain rice, and stir in the courgette slices, the egg, milk,
seasoning and half the cheese.  Put into ovenproof dish.

Make bread into crumbs and mix with remainder of cheese.  Spread on top of
rice  mixture, and bake in moderate oven for about 30 minutes until crust
is crisp.

             Sauces & Gravies
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1                     zucchini -- (courgette)
                        per person
  1                     tomato -- (beefsteak)
                        per two people
  1             medium  onion -- per two people
                        Salt and pepper -- to taste
                        eggplant -- optional

Instructions:


Wipe and slice courgettes.  Pour boiling water over tomato(es) and leave
for one minute or until the skins split.  Peel, and chop.  Peel and chop
onion.

Place all these vegetables in a saucepan and heat very gently until the
juices run.  You can gradually increase the heat as it gets more liquid.
When it is liquid, season to taste, bring to the boil, and simmer for about
10-15 minutes (I always allow 40 minutes' total cooking time for this, but
I think it does with a little less).

This is gorgeous over pasta, or if you have a meal that wants a little
"gravy", e.g. grilled or microwaved fish fillets, or even steak (well,
once in a blue moon I still have one...).  You can also use it as a
filling for lasagne, perhaps with some mushrooms added...

You can, of course, add to this an aubergine (eggplant), previously wiped
and sliced, in which case it is ratatouille.  Or you can use a vegetable
marrow (summer squash) instead of the courgette, but you need to remove
skin and pips if you use this.

Some people advocate sprinkling the sliced courgettes and aubergines
with salt and weighing them down for an hour, but I seldom do this - it
is definitely unnecessary if the vegetables are home-grown.

NOTE:  Original recipe called for 1/3 C olive oil/155 mL/5 fl oz.

Couscous is a tiny pasta that has long been popular in North Africa and is
so quick and easy to make.  You can add ingredients to this list or omit
items if you don't care for them, this is such an adaptable salad or side
dish.

In a med saucepan over high heat, bring the stock and saffron to a boil
and season with salt and pepper.  Place the couscous in a large
nonreactive bowl and pour the boiling stock over it.  Cover and set aside
for 1- min, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.  Fluff the couscous
up with a fork and set it aside.

In a med bowl, mix together the onion, garlic, tomato, ginger, currants,
cilantro and lime juice.  Slowly whisk in the olive oil and season with
slat and pepper.  Pour the mixture over the couscous and mix well.

Serve the Couscous Salad at room temp.

                        Seasoning

Instructions:

(In France, they make it with cous-cous, rather than
with bulghur wheat.  Makes an interesting change.)

Soak the cous-cous in about double its volume of boiling water, until
all the water is absorbed.  Peel and chop the tomatoes and onions,
and drain the sweetcorn and beans (you will probably want to rinse the
latter).  Mix everything together, season and dress with lemon juice,
and possibly 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil for the flavour - it makes so
much salad that it really doesn't up the % CFF too much.

Instructions:

PREPARATION (2 hours or overnight)
- Rinse peas and sort. Place in a bowl, cover with boiling water and soak for a t least 1 hour or overnight. Drain, place in a large saucepan and cover with fresh water. Cover (lid) and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat until tender, about 1 hour. Drain and set aside.

COOKING  (40 minutes)
- Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over low-medium heat. Add the garlic, onion, cinnamon, paprika and cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft, about 3 minutes.
- Add the carrots, turnips and sweet potatoes and cook, stirring continuously, for 5 minutes.
- Add the tomato juice and stock and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the chickpeas, okra/squash, apricots, mushrooms and
parsley and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 10-12 minutes. Season to taste with the salt and pepper.
- Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the couscous and sultanas and mix well with a fork. Remove the pan from the heat and let stand for 2 minutes to allow pasta to swell.  Add the remaining oil to center of the couscous, return pan to heat and cook over medium heat, stirring until heated through, about 4 minutes.
- Spoon couscous around the edge of a serving dish. Garnish with the chives. Spoon chickpea and vegetable mixture in the center and sprinkle with rose petals, if using. Serve immediately.

Ingredients:
     1/2        packet  couscous
  1              large  onion
  2             cloves  garlic
  2                     carrots -- (2 to 3)
  2                     potatoes -- (2 to 3)
  2                     carrots -- (2 to 3)
  2                     zucchini -- (courgettes)(2 to 3)
  2                     tomatoes -- or small tin
                        chopped tomatos (2 to 3)
  1              small  cauliflower
  1                tin  chickpeas -- (garbanzo beans)
  3             ounces  dried apricots -- or raisins (3 to 4)

Instructions:

Chop onion, carrots, garlic, tomatos.  Separate cauliflower into florets.
Cut potato into chunks.  If using dried apricots, cut in half.  Put
all vegetables including drained and rinsed chick peas (garbanzos) into
a large saucepan, cover with water.  Season with salt and pepper, and,
if possible, with ground cumin and coriander seed and perhaps some fresh
coriander (cilantro).  Do use any vegetables you have available; apart
from the onion and chick peas (garbanzos), the list is descriptive not
prescriptive.  Bring to boil and simmer for about half an hour, until
everything is cooked.

Meanwhile, cook couscous according to the instructions on the packet.
When ready, put on plate and put vegetables on top.  Couscous is
traditionally served with a hot chilli and garlic sauce, called harissa,
but any hot chilli sauce will do.  I use a West Indian pepper sauce
widely available in Britain; I'm sure there are similar ones all over
the world!  You buy harissa in tubes - I haven't seen it here, but it's
available in every French supermarket, and I've stocked up!!!

                        basil

                        garlic
                        carb

Instructions:

it's really good as a stuffing for other fish -- or you could make the
stuffing mixture, and bake it.

my original recipe was for baked stuffed trout with pistachios and gouda
cheese, but both the trout and pistachios and cheese add too much fat --
but the recipe would be good without.

pick a lf fish you like, but in butterfly fillets --

in a food processor, mix/chop spinach with fresh basil, onions, and
garlic.  mix by hand with crabmeat.  fill inside of fish filets, and roll
in bread crumbs, cornflake crumbs, whatever.

wrap individual filets in tinfoil, and bake for recommended time for fish
size.

you could do one large fish, or many one-serving ones.  you could also
add a bit of fresh-grated parmesean to the crab/spinach mix.

             Eat-Lf Mailing List
             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        Base:
  3               cups  Grape-Nuts(r)
  1                cup  skim milk
  1                cup  unsweetened applesauce
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1                cup  craisins -- (dried cranberries)
                        Sauce:
     2/3           cup  cranberries -- up to 1 cup, washed
     3/4           cup  water -- to 1 cup
     1/3           cup  sugar -- or to taste
                        ***
                        frozen yogurt, vanilla -- nonfat

Instructions:

Mix the ingredients until moistened. Spread into a greased 8 or 9 inch square
cake pan (or 9 x 13) pan and bake at 350F for 30-35 minutes. Cool and cut into
squares.
Note: These are not sweet. They are similar to granola bars in texture but have
more moisture. More like a soft granola bar (if such a thing exists.) These
bars make a great breakfast on the run.

The sauce:
Rinse and drain 2/3- 1 cup whole cranberries. Simmer them in 3/4-1 cup
(approx.) of water until the berries pop a bit. Add sugar to taste. I added
maybe 1/3 cup and the berries still had some tartness. When the sugar dissolves
remove from the heat.

Place a slice of the base in a bowl. Top with vanilla no fat yogurt and a
drizzle of the cranberry sauce. A really yummy treat. Not to mention a great
way to get rid of those Grape Nuts! Seriously- it reminded me of the brownie
sundaes that I used to eat in the old days. Someday I might try this with
blueberries.

There is a wonderful native american cooking book available. Cox, Beverly and Jacobs, Martin. SPIRIT OF THE HARVEST:North American Indian Cooking. New York:Stewart, Tabori and Chang Publishers. 1991. ISBN 1-55670-186-1.
The book is broken down into sections; Southeastern coast and woodlands, Northeastern coast and woodlands, the Great Plains, the Southwest and the West. Each section opens with a description of the native american tribes of the region, their lifestyle and their major food groups. Each recipe is introduced with the history of the recipe, including additions made after contact with Europeans. The appendix lists native american ingredients, how to prepare the ingredients, a list of mail order sources for unusual items, and a wonderful 4 page biblio. The photography in the book is phenomenal!It could easily be a "coffee table" book. (Price $35. But best of all the recipes are GOOD! Last Thanksgiving, my husband and I made our entire meal from recipes of the Northeastern coast, and it was one of the best Thanksgiving dinners ever.

In saucepan combine cranberries, syrup, and water.  Bring to boil over med-hi heat.  Reduce heat med-lo and cook, stiring often, for about 15 min., until berries burst and sauce has thickened.  Stir in allspice if desired.  Cool and serve at room temp.  Sauce is best made in advance so flavors will blend.  This is sooo good, I'll bet you eat a whole bowl by itself.  And I never liked cranberries!

Recipe:      Cranberry Muffins (Very)

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
                        A:
  1                cup  quick-cooking oats
     3/4           cup  skim milk
                        B:
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        C:
  1                cup  cranberry sauce -- whole
  2              whole  egg whites
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Instructions:


-Combine A and set aside 15 minutes to allow the milk to soak into the
oats.

-Combine B (dry ingredients) and stir to mix well

-Combine C and stir to mix well (maybe even beat to fluff the egg whites
a bit).

Fold A and C into B until dry ingredients are wetted.

Fold in 1/4C walnuts if desired (since these are listed in the book as
optional, I assume their contribution is not included in the 0.7 grams
of fat and 137 calories per muffin the book gives). I did use the
walnuts.

Coat a one dozen muffin pan with nonstick spray and parcel out the mix
(approximately 3/4 full for standard muffin size)

Bake for 18 minutes at 350 deg. F (I baked almost 30 minutes but my oven
may be off a bit) or until an inserted toothpick doesn't bring out wet
dough when removed.

Remove muffin pan and let cool for 5 minutes before attacking and
devouring.

Rather than whole berry cranberry sauce as listed in the book, I used
homemade cranberry relish (mixture of berries, whole orange and sugar as
given on the Ocean Spray cranberry package).

Without the walnuts, the fat content for these muffins is fairly low,
but the calories are still there, and I have to be careful not to eat
too many.

     1/4             C  Corn Syrup
  1                  C  Cranberries -- fresh or frozen

Instructions:

        I made these this weekend and they are pretty good.  As usual,
three of these muffins per day should help lower cholesterol levels...

(optional: 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, I didn't use)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine oat bran, sugar, and baking powder
in food processor with large metal blade.  Alow the food processor to
grind
the oat bran as you combine the moist ingredients in a separate bowl or
blender.  Add whole cranberries to the oat bran in the food processor and
pulse
the mixture for a few seconds to break up the berries.  Combine all
ingredients
in a large bowl and mix gently.  Pour batter into muffin pans lined with
paper baking cups.  Bake 15 minutes.  Test for doneness with a toothpick.

You don't have to use a food processor for this recipe.  Just omit the
grinding of the oatbran and cut the cranberries into small pieces with a
paring knife.  (I just stuck the cranberries in the blender)

is that easy or what!!!  I used my little oscar chopper so
it was REAL easy. You just have to be sure and do it in small

per serving 1 g fat, 80 cals. less if you use sugar twin.  I
figured it out and it was around 60 something calories.

Diabetic exchange 1/4 c =1/2 fruit - using sugar twin of course!
and pineapple in its own juice - no sugar added.

Instructions:

Pour milk into nonstick pan and slowly stir flour into the milk (I shake it
over the surface, then stir. You could also put the milk and flour in a
closed top container and shake it before adding to pan). Add Butterbuds the
same way, then add the hickory smoke, and slowly heat gravy, stirring
constantly, until its thick, about 5 minutes. Add pepper to taste, add more
hickory smoke or salt if needed, and serve over biscuits and vegan sausage.
Makes approximately 1 cup.

*To brown flour, stir the flour in a nonstick skillet over medium heat
until it is a _light_ brown color. Be careful to not scorch the flour or
your gravy will taste scorched.

Instructions:

  Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Dissolve
  the bouillon cube in the boiling water.  Add the broccoli and cook for 5
  to 6 minutes, until it is bright green and fork tender.

  Put the evaporated milk in a small saucepan.  Warm over low heat, just
  until bubbles begin to form around the edge.  Remove the pan from the
  heat.

  Preheat a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat for about 1 minute.
  Spray it twice with the vegetable oil.  Add the leeks and saute, stirring
  often, for 7 to 8 minutes, until limp.  Stir in the flour and cook for 1
  minute.  Whisk in the warm evaporated milk.  Continue to cook, whisking
  constantly, until the flour has dissolved and the mixture is smooth.

  Reduce the heat to low.  Add the nutmeg, the garlic, and the broccoli,
  along with its cooking liquid.  Simmer for 5 minutes more, taking care not
  to bring the soup to a boil.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
  basil and black pepper.

Ingredients:
  2               cups  nonfat dry milk
  2        tablespoons  onion flakes
  1           teaspoon  basil
  1           teaspoon  thyme
     1/4           cup  chicken bouillon
     3/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper

Instructions:

Mix all ingredients & store in an air tight container.  To reconstruct
to equal 1 can of cream soup:  add 1/3 c dry mixture to 1 1/4 c water in
a 4 cup microwavable cup.  Microwave on 70% for 7 minutes, until
thickened.  Can add celery, mushrooms, broccoli for "cream of whatever
soup".  Makes 3 cups dry mix which is equal to 9 cans of soup.  Use this
in any recipe that calls for cream soup.  It is also good with 2 slices
of non fat cheese added to use as a cheese sauce in casseroles.  Makes a
good lunch too!

I've also had this with a small (snack size - 3 oz?) can of tuna mixed in.
This is enough, with or without tuna, for a filling dinner for my husband and I.[Sally]

  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1             medium  yellow onion -- chopped

  1                can  evaporated skim milk -- 12 oz
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

Instructions:

CHOPPED MEASURES:  1-1/2 cup onion;  1-3/4 cup potato

PREPARE the broccoli by cutting off and reserving the dark
green florets. With a small, sharp knife, peel the stems
lengthwise to reach the tender, nonfibrous part inside.
Discard the peelings and coarsely chop the tender parts
of the stems. Set aside stems and florets.

In a large kettle, heat olive oil over medium-low heat.
Add onion and saute for 3 to 4 minutes or until soft. Add
garlic and saute 1 minute longer. Stir in the flour until
it coats the onion mixture and cook for 1 minute, stirring
constantly. Add the water and bring to a boil over low heat.
Add the potato, broccoli, salt, thyme and white pepper and
simmer covered for 35 minutes.

Add the evaporated skim milk and lemon juice and simmer
uncovered for 15 minutes longer. Strain broth and the
vegetables. Puree the vegetables in a food processor or
blender; (or use a hand-held immersion blender). Recombine
the pureed vegetables and the broth and stir well.
Makes 9-1/2 cups.

Ingredients:
  1              pound  crabmeat
  3              whole  green onions -- chopped (incl green)
  3        tablespoons  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
     3/4           cup  corn -- fresh or frozen
     1/2      teaspoon  dried dill weed
     1/4      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  12            ounces  evaporated skim milk
  1                cup  Egg Beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
     1/2           cup  nonfat sour cream

Instructions:

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly coat a 10-inch glass or ceramic pie
dish (or use an 11x7-inch glass baking pan) with vegetable cooking
spray. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the crab, parmesan cheese, green onion,
corn, dill weed, pepper, and salt. Toss well to blend evenly. Spread
mixture evenly across the bottom and 2/3 of the way up the sides of
the prepared baking dish.

In your now-empty medium bowl, combine the evaporated skim milk,
nonfat egg substitute, and nonfat sour cream. Beat with a fork or
whisk until combined. Pour evenly over the crab mixture. Bake 50-60
minutes, or until the quiche is set in the center (if your oven is
really at 350 degrees, 60 minutes is more likely than 50).

Allow to cool 10 minutes before slicing.

     1/2           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
     1/4           cup  Buttermilk
  3        tablespoons  Nonfat Mayonnaise

Instructions:

     Firm, small-seeded European cucumbers work best in this dressing. If
your cucumbers have large seeds, remove them before dicing.

I was reading today's Food section in the Boston Globe (5/4/94), and
thought of all of you on this list who are always looking for a good
recipe for low fat salad dressing.

     In a small bowl, stir ingredients together until evenly blended.
Spoon over greens. Makes about 1 cup dressing.

Crepes-good fillings and sauces

I tried a new recipe over the weekend that was an excellent "creamy"
salmon over pasta.  While it was great over pasta, I think it would be
just as good (maybe better?) as a filling for crepes.  It's from Skinny
One-Pot Meals by Ruth Glick.

Remove skin from salmon.  In large, non-stick, spray-coated skillet, cook
salmon, breaking up large pieces, until cooked through, about 11 to 12
minutes.  Remove from pan and set aside.

In same pan, combine onion, carrot, garlic, broth, and margarine.  Cook
over medium heat, stirring frequently, 6 to 7 minutes or until onion is
tender.

Mix in flour and stir to make a smooth paste.  Gradually add milk,
stirring constantly to make sure mixture remains smooth.  Add sherry,
lemon juice, dill, mustard, and pepper.  Simmer 3 or 4 minutes longer,
stirring frequently, until sauce thickens.

Meanwhile, flake salmon and fold into sauce.  Stir in sour cream.  Cook
over very low heat an additonal 3 or 4 minutes.

Arrange pasta on serving platter.  Top with salmon and sauce.  Or serve
individual portions over pasta.  Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.


Now, instead of serving this over pasta, you could use it to fill
crepes.  I think this would be a pretty elegant filling.

Then, a favorite crepe filling of mine is ratatouille, the summer
vegetable medley.  Most recipes call for more olive oil than you need,
but that is easily remedied.[Deb]

  2              parts  basic tomato sauce
  1               part  fat free sour cream
                        skim milk to thin

Instructions:

Mix together tomato sauce and sour cream, and thin with skim milk to
desired consistency.  Depending on how flavorful your tomato sauce is,
you may want to add salt, pepper, basil, oregano, parsley or whatever.
The nice thing about this sauce is that the somewhat granular consistency
of the fat free sour cream is completely masked by the tomato sauce, and
it comes out tasting rich and satisfying.

Ingredients:
                        ****

Instructions:

Basically you boil a can of sweetened condensed milk
for an hour or more (don't let it boil dry!).  Let the can cool in the
water, then refrigerate.  Don't try to open it when hot.  This apparently
makes a sweet rich dessert (tho quite high in sugar), and presumable could
be put in custard cups, topped with brown sugar, and put under the broiler
for a creme caramel type finish. I understand that this technique works
quite well with the fat-free condensed milk which is available in the
States.  I must confess I have never tried it, it sounds a bit repulsive
to me, but I never cared for creme caramel either, which I am guessing is
a cousin of creme brule.  I apologize if this has been posted before.

Ingredients:
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  3              large  egg whites
  1                can  lowfat sweetened condensed milk -- (14 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  skim milk
  1                tbl  vanilla extract

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a small heavy saucepan, combine sugar
with 1/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring
occasionally. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, without
stirring, until the syrup turns a deep amber color, about 5 minutes.
(Swirl the pan if the syrup is coloring unevenly.) Immediately pour the
syrup into a 1 1/2 to 2 quart souffle dish or casserole and carefully
tilt the dish so that the caramel coats halfway up the side.

In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and egg whites. Add the condensed
milk, skim milk and vanilla, blending well.

Pour the mixture through a fine strainer into the caramel-coated dish.
Set the dish in a larger shallow pan, such as a roasting pan. Pour enough
hot water ino the larger pan so it comes halfway up the side of the
custard dish. Bake for 60-70 minutes or until custard is set around the
edges but still wobbly in the center.

Remove the dish from its water bath to a rack to cool to room
temperature. Then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or
overnight. To serve, run a knife around the edge of the dish and invert
the flan onto a plate.

Ingredients:
  2             pounds  Russet Potatoes -- boiled in skins till
                        -- tender
  1              Bunch  Green Onions -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  Basil -- crushed
                        or Italian herb seasoning
                        Black Pepper -- freshly ground
     1/2           cup  Vegetable broth -- chicken flavored
                        Paprika -- Hungarian
  3        tablespoons  Italian Parsley -- freshly chopped
                        or fresh basil -- for garnish

Instructions:


Peel cooked potatoes and dice in 1" cubes.

Place in an 8x11x2" baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick spray.
 Sprinkle with chopped green onions, Italian seasoning, and freshly ground
pepper.  Mix gently with a fork to distribute the ingred.

Pour chicken stock over the potatoes and sprinkle generously with
Hungarian paprika.

Bake in a preheated 400 deg F. oven on upper shelf.  Stir every 15 min
until nicely browned and crisp, about 45 min.  Place under broiler to
complete browning before serving.

To Serve:
Garnish with freshly chopped Italian parsley or fresh basil.  Because it
is so easy to prepare, this dish lends itself nicely to outdoor
entertaining for lg parties.

VARIATION:
In step 4, after stirring, spray with a mixture of 3 Tbsp mild soy sauce
and 1/4 C water placed in a plastic spray bottle.  Stir again.  Spray and
stir every 15 min.  This will, of course, increase the sodium content of
the recipe.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  10            medium  apples -- up to 12
  1               cups  cranberry juice -- up to 2cups
     1/2                Lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  Sugar -- or up to 1/4cup if
                        You want it sweet
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries -- "craisins" (1/4 to
                        -- 1/2)

Instructions:


Wash the apples and chop them up without peeling.
Squeeze lemon juice over them as you cut them.


 Put apples in crockpot with cranberry juice -- use 1 cup if you want the applesauce thick, more if you want it thin.  Stir in sugar to suit your taste.


 Let apples stew on Low for 6-8 hours.  About an hour or two before serving, stir in cranberries or craisins.  (All I found at my store was craisins--since they're sweetened, I used less sugar.)
 The applesauce is a very pretty pink and the cranberries & juice give it a nice zing.


 As you can see, the recipe is simple and forgiving -- let the apples stew a little longer or a little less ~- the longer you stew them the mushier the applesauce will be.  It warms up nicely, or you can eat it cold.

                        Salt And Pepper -- to taste

Instructions:

* or any other beans, drained (This will yield 10 oz of beans)

Combine all ingredients in a crockpot. Add water to reserved tomato liquid
to equal 2 1/2 C.  Stir into grain mixture.  Cover and cook on low setting
8 hrs.  Stir before serving.

I just put all the dry ingredients in the crockpot the night before, in
the morning all the wet ingredients and turn the crockpot on.  By the time
dinner rolls around it is ready.

This serves 8 as a side dish and 4 - 6 as a filling main course.

You can use any combination of grains. Just use about 1 cupful altogether-
although I have used more then 1 cupful.

frig.  Zucchini, green beans,peas are just a few ideas.

Ingredients:
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- or use Pam
  2             pounds  whole chicken
  3              large  onions -- peeled and chopped
  5              large  tomatoes -- chopped
  1             medium  orange -- unpeeled, seeded, ch
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  pepper
     1/2           cup  water
  1                     chicken bouillon cube -- crumbled
  3        tablespoons  currant jelly -- red, or raspberry
     1/4           cup  sweet sherry

Instructions:


In a medium skillet, over medium high heat, heat the oil and saute the
chicken, turning often, until well browned all over.  Remove the chicken
to a plate.  Saute the onion in the skillet until well browned.  Turn
into the crockpot.  Place the tomatoes, orange, sugar, salt and pepper
in the pot and set the chicken on top.  Rinse the skillet with the water
and scrape into the cooker.  Add the bouillon cube.  Cover and cook on
Low for 5 to 7 hours. Before serving, remove the chicken to a deep serving dish and keep warm. Turn the pot contents into a skillet, set the heat to high and simmer
until thick enough to mound on a spoon.  Stir in the jelly and the
sherry and cook, stirring until the sauce boils.  Do not overcook, lest
the sauce lose its shiny quality.  If you wish, add some sugar or sweet
sherry to further brighten the taste.  If sauce is not shiny enough,
bring back to a very brisk boil and quickly stir in some jelly.  Pour
sauce over the chicken.

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped

Dressing (not a lot) sprinkle on spices (Spike plus cayenne pepper is nice),
and bake in a single layer on a cookie sheet in a slow oven, flipping them

                        olive oil -- or spray

Instructions:

Just cut up bread (preferrably older bread) and add spice.  I use
garlic salt, pepper, and italian herbs mixed with olive oil.  Try to
distribute the oil amoung the pieces.  You could probably use spray oil
(like Pam) and spinkle with the spice mixture.  Toss and bake around
250 degrees.  The more fat the more savory...less fat the
toastier..depends on my mood and the other items I am putting in the
salad.

Instructions:

you should
roast asparagus at 500 degrees. She says to use 1 1/2 tsp of olive oil
for 1 pound of aspargus. She doesn't use anything else. Just put the oil
in a pan big enough to just fit the asparagus in one layer. Roll the
asparagus around in the oil. Roast on the lowest rack in a 500 oven. I
think she said 10-15 minutes. Turn after 5 minutes.

You can sprinkle them with salt, salt and lemon juice afterward. It's so
easy and so tasty.

I have tried this recipe for fruit crumble topping, and it
is pretty sweet but a good crunchy crumb topping.  On top of a
cake, I would probably start with much less sugar (I used it on
defrosted unsweetened fruit).

SHOW #TH 6243

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the pork loin on a rack over a
   roasting pan and fill the bottom with about 1-inch of beer. Season the
   pork generously with salt and pepper.

   In a mixing bowl, combine the orange juice, honey, soy sauce, sherry,
   hoisin sauce, mashed black beans, fivespice powder, and garlic. Mix
   together well and coat the pork loin with this paste, rubbing it in
   well and using up all the mixture. Roast the pork for 15 minutes, then
   reduce the heat to 325 degrees and cook for 45 to 60 minutes more,
   basting every 15 to 20 minutes with the orangehoney mixture. When the
   pork is thoroughly cooked (it should register 165 degrees on a meat
   thermometer, and the juices run clear rather than pink), remove from
   the oven and rest for 5 minutes. Transfer to a warmed serving platter
   and surround with orange segments and watercress sprigs. Serve
   immediately, slicing the loin at the table.

   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

occasionally. Add cucumbers, lemon juice and stock. Bring to a boil over medium
heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until cucumbers are

together garlic, basil and walnuts to a paste. (you can also use a bowl with a
wooden spoon). Work in a little cheese and oil and one-third of the tomato.
Keep adding cheese, oil and tomato. The mixture will not be a true emulsion but
a barely fluid paste.
 Transfer cucumber mixture to a food processor or blender and puree, in batches,
until smooth.  Ladle soup into serving bowl. Pass the pistou. Allow 1 tablespoon
of pistou per serving to be placed in the center of the bowl, then swirl into

     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
                        Olive oil to saute
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  2               cups  chicken bouillon
  1 1/2           cups  lowfat 1% milk
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch

Instructions:

(serves 4)

I used about 1 teaspoon of olive oil to saute the vegetables, and I used
skim milk.  As I said, it's delicious.  I'll definitely be making it again. [Deborah]
In a 3-quart saucepan, saute the chopped vegetables in olive oil,
along with the curry, until tender.  Add the bouillon and bring to a
near- boil.  Add the fish and let simmer until it flakes easily, about
15 minutes.  In the meantime, stir the corn starch into the milk until
it is dissolved, and add to the soup when the fish is ready.  Cook and
stir until bubbly.  Voila!

             Turkey

Ingredients:
  1              large  onion
  2             cloves  garlic
  1              pound  turkey -- chunks or minced
                        beef or quorn, minced
  1              small  banana
  1                     apple
  2                 oz  frozen peas -- (2 to 3)
  2                 oz  frozen corn -- (2 to 3)
  2             ounces  golden raisins -- (sultanas) (2 to 3)
  1 1/4          pints  chicken stock -- or any stock
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  1              small  green chilli -- chopped
  1              Piece  ginger root -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  coriander -- chopped (cilantro)

Instructions:

This isn't authentic Indian; it's a Good British Curry (the kind that
did something - not sure what - to the Empire), but it's very good.

Please note, this recipe is not vegetarian, but could easily be adapted.

If using beef mince, dry fry and pour off juices and fat.  Otherwise
saute meat/quorn with curry powder, I found I needed to use about
2 tablespoons of the stock to do this in.  Add onion and chopped/crushed
garlic.  If you aren't using meat, then saute the onion and garlic with
the curry powder.  When brown add the sliced banana and the chopped
apple (do not use the core!).  Then add the rest of the stock, peas,
sweetcorn, sultanas, chilli, ginger root, coriander, and a little salt.
Bring to boil and leave to simmer for about an hour, stirring occasionally.

Serve with rice which you have boiled with some saffron to make it yellow
- if you haven't any saffron, use turmeric, or leave it plain - with
mango chutney and we like cucumber and chives chopped and mixed with
natural yogurt.  My daughter suggested stirring in a spoonful of natural
yogurt just before serving the curry, but I forgot!

I also served green beans and courgettes (zucchini) with this.  Yes, I
missed desecrated - sorry, dessicated (family word!) - coconut, and I
missed peanuts, but not too badly.

Variations: As already suggested you could use quorn instead of meat.
If you eat eggs, you could serve the sauce over a hard boiled egg.
Or with just vegetables.

  1              small  onion -- chopped very fine
  3                 T.  curry powder -- (3 to 4)
                        or Patak's Kebab Curry Paste
                        Chili powder to taste
                        Cumin to taste
                        Coriander to taste
  2               cups  lentils
  3                     carrots -- chopped (3 to 4)
  1                     red pepper -- cut into strips
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  vegetable stock
     1/4           cup  yogurt
                        chutney or lime pickle to top

Instructions:

Chop a small onion very fine. saute it (don't use olive oil), and then
     add curry powder OR a prepared curry paste. i usually use about 3-4 T
     of Patak's Kebab Paste. other spices are up to
     you. i usually add chili powder, cumin and coriander. add 2 cups of
     lentil, and water/stock (1:1 is good) to cover. simmer for an hour,
     add more liquid if necessary. adjust seasoning.  then add 1 package of
     frozen spinach (fresh is ok, but frozen is convenient and just as
     tasty) and cook for about 10 more minutes.

Now the fun part. to serve, put a helping into a bowl and add several
     spoonfuls of yogurt and stir. top with chutney or lime pickle. it
     looks weird, but tastes terrific, AND is incredibly high in protein
     and iron, and low in fat.
     it will also be a nice complement if you're eating a mostly liquid
     diet while recovering from surgery, if you get my drift.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention. 3-4 chopped carrots can be added as
     well, when the lentils are partially cooked. strips of red pepper look
     nice too.

couple of chicken breasts in a big pot with
2 cups of water.  After it begins to boil, I slice into bite-sized chunks
5 potatoes, 5 carrots, one yellow onion, one green pepper and 2 stalks of
celery and add to the pot.  When they have begun to soften, I add a can
of mushrooms and a half cup each of frozen peas and corn.  Turn it down
to low heat when it begins to boil and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add 1 T.
of salt, 1/2 T. of pepper and 2 T. of curry powder.  Dissolve 1 T. of corn
starch in a cup of water and mix into stew.  Let it simmer for another 10
minutes and it is ready to serve over rice.  You can adjust the
seasonings to your taste and add more corn starch if you like it
thicker.  This recipe serves 8 easily.  Hope you like it.

Whisk milk, sugar, cornstarch and eggs in heavy saucepan until smooth.  Watch

just watch it.

Custard sauce may be made and refrigerated and eaten as is, or over fruit

  14                Oz  canned tomatoes
  8                 Oz  canned corn -- (or frozen),opt
  4             Ounces  lowfat cheddar cheese
  2             Slices  bread -- crumbled into crumbs
                        (use food processor)
  8             Ounces  macaroni
  1         Tablespoon  all-purpose flour -- heaping
  1           Teaspoon  olive oil -- optional

Instructions:

Cook macaroni in boiling salted water according to instructions.
Meanwhile, chop onion and crush garlic, if using, and microwave for
five minutes.  Put tomatoes, flour, [oil] and half the can of water
into food processor (you can, if you like and 2 tablespoons of dried
skimmed milk powder, but you don't have to) and whizz until smooth.

Put onions and tomato mixture into saucepan, and bring to the boil,
stirring all the time.  When it is boiling, it will change colour
and go a much deeper pink.  Turn off heat, add half the cheese and
the sweetcorn.  You might also like to add some chopped bacon, if
you are not a vegetarian.  Season to taste - I use salt, pepper,
Worcester sauce - also fresh basil, if I have it; oregano, etc.

Combine macaroni and sauce in an oven-proof dish and top with
the breadcrumbs mixed with the remainder of the grated cheese.
Cook in a moderate oven for about 30-45 minutes (it is pretty
forgiving).  Serve with salad.

Ingredients:
                        Caramel:
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      Teaspoon  cold water
                        Custard:
     1/2           Cup  evaporated skim milk
  1 1/2      Teaspoons  sugar

     1/4      Teaspoon  vanilla

Instructions:


VLF Flan/Custard

I finally remembered to bring one of my favourite recipes in with me
today so that I could share it with you all.  The following is from the
"Golden Edition Cookbook" with recipes by Winifred Morice and Richard
Simmons (I know, I know, but some of the recipes really are great--especially
when cooking for one).

1.  To make caramel: In glass custard bowl dissolve sugar in water.
     Microwave on HIGH (100% power) 1 to 2 minutes.  (Watch carefully and
     remove as soon as sugar turns color).
2.   To make custard:  In a small bowl, whisk together all custard
     ingredients.
3.   Pour custard over caramelized sugar.
4.   Microwave on DEFROST (30% power) 2 minutes or until pudding is just set.
5.   Refrigerate 1 hour or longer.  Unmold.

     Makes 1 serving.

I find when making this that the cooking times tend to vary quite a bit
with my microwave.  The main thing is just to keep an eye on both the
caramel (definitely take it out the instant it turns colour) and the
custard (be sure not to take it out of the microwave until it is set).

Instructions:

Cook beans as in Black Bean Soup recipe, but before you grind them,
let them drain for about 2 hrs.  Don't worry if they look
terrible after sitting that long.  Save the liquid for soup.

NOTE: You may use canned black beans, too.

Put the cooked beans through a food mill or food processor or
meat grinder.  Mix them with chili powder, cumin, fresh chili,
cilantro leaves, and salt into a paste.

Roll the paste into 4 equal balls.  Put each ball between two
sheets of waxed paper. Press them into rounds 1/8 inch thick
between the palms of your hand.  set aside.

  Whisk sour cream and milk until smooth.

  Heat oil in nonstick pan or griddle.  When pan is hot, put in
  cakes and cook 2 min. on each side.

  Put cakes on awrm plates, spoon sour cream in middle of each
  cake.  Spoon the salsa on the sour cream.  Garnish the plates
  with cilantro leaves.

"What I would like on my tombstone, 'He invented black
bean cake'. ... it is one of those dishes that the public
will not let me take off the menu.  It is simple, beautiful,
easy and fast."  Jeremiah Tower, chef, Stars, SF.
