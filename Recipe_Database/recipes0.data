Ingredients:
     3/4         pound  Atlantic salmon -- fillets or steaks
                        cut into 2" pieces
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- peeled and grated
                        or shredded
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  3        tablespoons  nonfat chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  diet margarine
  2        tablespoons  white flour
  1 3/4           cups  1% milk -- or skim
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  dried dill weed
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/8      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/3           cup  nonfat sour cream
                        salt -- to taste, optional
  1               thin  spaghetti -- (8 oz)  cooked
                        according to package directions (8 to 10)
                        chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

I tried a new recipe over the weekend that was an excellent "creamy" salmon over pasta.  While
it was great over pasta, I think it would be just as good (maybe better?) as a filling for crepes.
[Deb]

Remove skin from salmon.  In large, non-stick, spray-coated skillet, cook salmon, breaking up large
pieces, until cooked through, about 11 to 12 minutes.  Remove from pan and set aside.

In same pan, combine onion, carrot, garlic, broth, and margarine.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
frequently, 6 to 7 minutes or until onion is tender.

Mix in flour and stir to make a smooth paste.  Gradually add milk, stirring constantly to make sure
mixture remains smooth.  Add sherry, lemon juice, dill, mustard, and pepper.  Simmer 3 or 4
minutes longer, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens.

Meanwhile, flake salmon and fold into sauce.  Stir in sour cream.  Cook over very low heat an
additonal 3 or 4 minutes.

Arrange pasta on serving platter.  Top with salmon and sauce.  Or serve individual portions over
pasta.  Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.

Now, instead of serving this over pasta, you could use it to fill
crepes.  I think this would be a pretty elegant filling.  Then, a favorite crepe filling of mine is
ratatouille, the summer vegetable medley.  Most recipes call for more olive oil than you need,
but that is easily remedied.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1                Can  Peaches -- juice packed

Instructions:

This is a frozen dessert, that, with a little pre-planning,
is practically instant.

 Take a can of juice-packed peaches or pineapple.  Freeze it for
several hours.  (That's right, just put the can in the freezer!)
Open and dump frozen contents into food processor with metal
chopping blade in place or into a blender.  Process until desired
consistency. Enjoy!

Note: You can also do this with frozen bananas.  I find this is a
good way to use them this time of year when they get over-ripe so
quickly.  Freeze them* in "zip-lock" type bags - peeling them when
frozen can give you frostbite!  They end up very creamy--like very rich
ice cream...but with no added fat,sugar, etc...   *w/o peels

This is actually quite good and extremely easy!!

             Eat-Lf Mailing List

Ingredients:
  12                    chicken thighs without skin
                        -- or- drumsticks
                        Cooking spray
     1/2     container  egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
  1 1/2           cups  bread crumbs -- flavored

Instructions:

Dip each of the chicken pieces in Egg Beaters, then coat with bread crumbs
and place in baking pan--which you've coated lightly with cooking spray--or
dish.  (At this point, I usually apply a light, quick spray of cooking
spray to the tops of the chicken pieces.)  Cover with foil and bake for 50
minutes in an oven pre-heated to 375 degrees.  Remove foil and bake for 10
more minutes.
