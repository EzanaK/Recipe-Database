Ingredients:
  1                Can  Peaches -- juice packed

Instructions:

This is a frozen dessert, that, with a little pre-planning,
is practically instant.

 Take a can of juice-packed peaches or pineapple.  Freeze it for
several hours.  (That's right, just put the can in the freezer!)
Open and dump frozen contents into food processor with metal
chopping blade in place or into a blender.  Process until desired
consistency. Enjoy!

Note: You can also do this with frozen bananas.  I find this is a
good way to use them this time of year when they get over-ripe so
quickly.  Freeze them* in "zip-lock" type bags - peeling them when
frozen can give you frostbite!  They end up very creamy--like very rich
ice cream...but with no added fat,sugar, etc...   *w/o peels

This is actually quite good and extremely easy!!
