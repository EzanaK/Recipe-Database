Recipe:      "Waldorf" Salad (Mother's)

Ingredients:
                        Waldorf salad
                        Baby corn -- thinly sliced
                        nonfat mayonnaise
                        nonfat yogurt

Instructions:

My mother's way of defatting a waldorf salad was to use apples and celery
as normal, but to replace the walnuts with thinly-sliced baby corn on the
cobs.  I don't normally like those, but sliced small they were very good,
and had an interesting texture.  For dressing, she used reduced-calorie
mayonnaise mixed 50:50 with low fat (I hope! I didn't dare ask!) yogurt.

  1           teaspoon  italian seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
  1               part  nonfat ricotta cheese -- (15 oz)   *See note

  1                jar  tomato and herb pasta sauce

Instructions:

-Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat: set aside.

-Coat a small nonstick skillet with cooking spray, and place over
medium-high heat until hot.  Add onion and garlic; saute 3 minutes.  Remove
from heat and set aside.

-Combine 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, and next 5
ingredients in a bowl; beat at medium speed until smooth.  Stir in onion
mixture and spinach.

-Spoon mozzarella cheese mixture into cooked manicotti about 1/3 cup per shell.

and then spread remaining sauce on top.  Sprinkle remaining mozzarella
cheese and parmesan cheese;  cover and bake for 40 minutes.  Remove foil and
bake for an additional 10 minutes or until cheese has browned.

*Note:  I used nonfat cheeses as much as possible and had no ill affect on
the recipe.  In fact my SAD friends were clamouring for the recipe and did
not believe me when I said it was lofat.  Just goes to show you.

(I just remade this recipe this evening for dinner and used a fatfree
spaghetti sauce that I got from the HFS along with some homemade fatfree
manicotti that I got from my local pasta market.  It was fabulous, I think
even better than the original)

Ingredients:
  2                     Acorn squash -- (1 1/2lb each)
     1/2         pound  Brussel sprouts -- small
  2          teaspoons  Olive oil
  1                cup  onion -- diced
  1           teaspoon  Fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  Dried marjoram
     1/4           cup  fresh sage -- minced
     1/4           cup  Fresh orange juice
  2          teaspoons  Fresh lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  Freshly ground black pepper
  2               cups  wild rice -- cooked

Instructions:

  1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).

  2.  Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp.  In a large
  baking dish, place the squash, cut side down, with about 1 inch of
  water. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes.

  3.  Pour about 2 inches of water into a large stockpot.  Place a
  collapsible steamer in the pot, cover, and bring to a boil.  Place the
  Brussels sprouts in the steamer, cover, and steam for 5 to 7 minutes,
  or until tender.  Set aside.

  4.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over low heat.  Add
  the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the
  fennel, marjoram, sage, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper, and
  simmer for 3 minutes.  Stir in the cooked wild rice and the Brussels
  sprouts and heat through.

  5.  Spoon the wild rice and Brussels sprout mixture into the squash
  cavities.  Serve immediately.

  I often microwave the acorn squash by placing in a shallow glass pan
  with about 1/2-inch of water, covering with saran wrap and nuking for
  about 10 minutes or until tender.

  2                med  carrots -- cleaned and chopped
  2                 lg  celery stalk -- chopped
  1                med  red onion -- cleaned
  1              clove  garlic -- peeled
  1 1/2            lbs  fresh tomatoes -- or canned
  1               tbsp  tomato paste
                        salt and pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  2                qts  cold water
     1/2             c  egg beaters(r) 99% egg substitute
  8               tbsp  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
  2                  c  croutons

Instructions:

Soak the mushrooms in a bowl of lukewarm water for 1/2 hour to rehydrate.
Drain the mushrooms (reserving the liquid), making sure that no sand
remains attached to the stems.

Finely chop carrots, celery, onion, garlic and the soaked mushrooms all
together on a board.

Heat the oil (or mushroom liquid) in a heavy casserole over medium heat.

When the sauteing liquid is warm, add the chopped ingredients and saute
for 10 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon as needed.

Meanwhile pass the tomatoes through a food mill, using the disk with the
smallest holes, into a small bowl.

Add the strained tomatoes, along with the tomato paste, then salt, pepper
and red pepper flakes. Let simmer for 15 minutes, mixing every so often.

Add the cold water, mix very well and, when the broth returns to a boil,
let simmer for 55 minutes.

Place the egg beaters (or two eggs) in a crockery or china soup tureen and
mix them very well with the Parmigiano cheese.

When the soup is ready, ladle it into the tureen, and using a wooden
spoon, mix each addition very well with the egg-cheese combination in
order to avoid curdling.

When the broth is very smooth and the eggs completely amalgamated, add the
croutons and serve immediately. (If using bread slices instead, place a
slice in each bowl and ladle the broth over top. Serve immediately.)

     1/2      teaspoon  chicken bouillon -- or chicken flavored
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  ground black pepper
                  dash  ground red pepper
  1         tablespoon  flour -- optional
                  drop  olive oil -- optional
                        sauteed mushrooms and onions -- optional

Instructions:

Combine all ingredients in container of an electric blender; process until
smooth, stopping once to scrape down sides. Pour into a small saucepan; cook
sauce over low heat, stirring constantly, until thoroughly heated.

[NOTES:

 1) We buy freshly-grated Parmesan (NOT lowfat parm!) at the grocery
    and keep it in the fridge. The flavor is a lot stronger, and a
    little bit goes a lot farther, than the dry stuff in the green can.

 2) butter-flavored granules: Butter Buds, Molly McButter, etc.;
    find these in the spice section of the supermarket. We buy both
    the packets that make 1/2 cup of liquid butter each, and the little
    plastic shaker bottle. That way we can make liquid butter in more
    bulk, but still have an easy way to sprinkle on foods or use in
    small quantities.

 3) evaporated skim milk: Carnation brand has "Lite" in cursive script
    on the can. If you can't find it for some reason, either ask me for
    some (we buy it a dozen cans at a time), or use powdered nonfat
    milk and mix it double-strength, or use skim milk and gently reduce
    it by half.]

Ingredients:
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  baking soda
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2                     eggs -- (room temperature)
                        NOTE: I see no reason why egg substitute
                        would not work just fine here.
  2                     egg whites -- (room temperature)
  1         tablespoon  almond extract
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  2             ounces  almonds -- lightly toasted,
                        chopped (optional)

Instructions:

If you like hard and crunchy biscotti, these are for you.
Dunk them in coffee or milk.(Tina)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper,
or spray with nonstick cooking spray.  In medium bowl, sift together
flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda.  In large bowl, with electric
mixer on high speed, combine sugar, eggs, egg whites and almond extract
until well blended, 1 minute.  Scrape bowl with rubber spatula.  Blend in
half of the flour mixture with spatula, then beat with mixer on low for
several second.  Add remaining flour mixture and continue beating until
smooth, about 5 seconds.  Add almonds, if using, and beat just to combine.

Divide dough into 2 pieces and spread each onto the center of a prepared
baking sheet, smoothing each into a 12 x 2 inch strip.  Bake until firm
and light gold, 25-30 minutes.  Lower oven temperature to 300 degrees.
Cool cookies on rack 10 minutes.  With serrated knife, cut each strip
into twenty-four 1/2 inch slices.  Arrange slices standing upright on
baking sheets, 1/2 inch apart.  Bake until crisp and light gold, about 35
minutes.

minutes more, scraping sides of bowl.  In another mixing bowl, mix
together dry ingredients. On medium setting,  add dry ingredients in small
amounts, alternating with small amounts of the milk, to the wet mixture,
beating continously and ending with the flour mixture.  Batter should be
smooth and uniform.  Pour batter into loaf pan coated with cooking spray

right amount of sweetness to this cake!

Ingredients:
     1/2           cup  lentils -- rinsed
     1/2           cup  navy beans -- rinsed
  2               cups  chopped onion
  2               cups  celery -- coarsely chopped
  5                     carrots -- scrubbed and
                        chunked into 1-inch pieces
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1                cup  barley
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  black pepper
     1/2           cup  cooking wine -- red
  1              quart  low sodium vegetable juice -- V8
  2               cups  water

Instructions:

Combine all ingredients in a Crockpot and cook for 8-10 hours on
medium or low heat, or 4-5 hours on high heat.
Remove bay leaves before serving.
Note: The flavor of this stew improves with time. For best results,
      prepare stew one to three days before serving.
Also, if added salt is desired, add salt at the end of cooking
time--adding salt too soon can toughen the seed coats on the lentils.

MY VERSION [Karen Ferner]:
(I boil the beans for 15 minutes and then add everything else. I do it on
top of the stove and cook for 2 hours.  The beans were still hard when
I cooked it in the crock pot, yuch!)

     1/4           cup  buttermilk
  4 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  3               cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast
     2/3           cup  canola oil
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
  1              whole  egg -- or 2 egg whites
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  2               cups  hazelnuts -- coarsely chopped
  2               cups  cherries -- dried,or cranberries

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F

2. In a large non-reactive bowl, mix 3/4 c. skim milk, 1/4 c.
buttermilk, 3/4 c. of the all-purpose flour, 1/4 c. whole-wheat flour,
1 tsp. sugar, and the yeast.  Set aside for 10 min. or until
the mixture starts to bubble.  [I warmed the milk slightly
before adding it to the yeast.]

3. In a large mixing bowl, place the remaining ingredients,
except for the hazelnuts and dried fruit, and mix well. Add the
milk mixture to the bowl and mix well.  Fold in the hazelnuts
and the dried fruit.

4. Lightly wipe four 10x5x2-in. loaf pans with vegetable oil,
divide the dough among the pans, and bake for 1 hr. and 10
minutes [this was too long for my oven], or until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out clean.

  1                cup  milk

Instructions:

Place 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk and 1 cup flour in a large plastic ziploc bag.  Keep sealed and squeeze every day for 17 days. (room temp)Let the air out if you need to.
On day 18 do nothing.  On days 19,20, and 21 stir.  On day 22 stir and add 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk and 1 cup flour. and squeeze again.  On days 23,24, and 25 and 26 squeeze.  On day 27 add 1 cup milk, 1 cup flour and 1 cup sugar.  squeeze until mixed well.  It is now ready to use.  Use one cup for the bread, one cup to keep and give the rest away.  The original starters do not normally call for yeast in the recipe because when they began years ago there was no such thing as yeast.  I have the recipe to keep it going if anyone wants it.

             Vegetarian

Ingredients:
  1           Teaspoon  sugar
  2               Cups  warm water
  2               Cups  flour
  1            Package  active dry yeast

Instructions:

How to care for your starter:
*       DO NOT REFRIGERATE THE BATTER
*       IF AIR GETS IN THE BAG - LET IT OUT
*       DO NOT USE A METAL SPOON OR BOWL FOR MIXING
*       IT IS NORMAL FOR THE BATTER TO THICKEN, BUBBLE, AND FERMENT

DAY ONE - This is the day you receive the batter - do nothing.
DAY TWO - Squeeze the bag, gently mixing the contents.
DAY THREE - Squeeze the bag, gently mixing the contents.
DAY FOUR - Squeeze the bag, gently mixing the contents.
DAY FIVE - Squeeze the bag, gently mixing the contents.
DAY SIX - Add 1 cup sugar, 1 cup flour, and 1 cup milk.  Squeeze the bag,
gently mixing the contents.
DAY SEVEN - Squeeze the bag, gently mixing the contents.
DAY EIGHT - Squeeze the bag, gently mixing the contents.
DAY NINE - Squeeze the bag, gently mixing the contents.
DAY TEN - Pour the batter into a large plastic or glass bowl for mixing.
Pour                  1 cup starter into four ziplock bags.  Keep two
starters                        for yourself (one to make - one to nurse)
and give the                  other two to friends along with a copy of
these                                 instructions.

If you should need to start a new batch of starter, use the following:
1 tsp sugar                     2 cups warm water               2 cups flour
1 pkg active dry yeast
Dissolve sugar in 1/2 cup water.  Add yeast and let stand 10 minutes.  Add
remaining water and flour.  Beat until smooth.  Pour into ziplock bag and
seal.  The next day start the 10 day feeding schedule listed above.

Recipe:      Amish Friendship Bread Starter, Freezing

             Information, Tips, Misc.

Ingredients:
                  ****

Instructions:

I saw the notes about the Amish Friendship Starter and thought I would let
you know how I freeze it for future use.  (Saves wearing out my friends
presenting them with a new starter every 10 days! <G>)

After the tenth day, when you've divided the starter up to give away or use
for yourself, simply put one portion in a quart-size ziplock bag, squeeze
all the air out, seal and freeze.  Go ahead and give away the others, use
them for baking or freeze them in individual portions, too.  When you're
ready to use the starter again, take it out of the freezer, let thaw in the
bag and then place in a larger bag or immediately place in a larger bag and
let thaw (see? this stuff is versatile <g>), then begin the process with the
DAY ONE instructions.  Start counting the time as soon as it's thawed.
 Usually this will take only a few hours at room temperature so the day you
take it from the freezer becomes DAY ONE.

Also, since DAY ONE is the same day that the original preparer baked with
the Starter (it's a loop, you know), you can also thaw the Starter and bake
with it immediately.  This way you could freeze two individual portions for
later use; prepare a recipe with one as soon as it's thawed and use the the
other to start a new round as described above.

Hope this helps you enjoy the Starter.  I always liked it but quickly became
overwhelmed with it after the first division.  I've used this method for
years with a true sourdough starter that I have (originally made with
potatoes, flour and well water -- no commercial yeast) and tried it a few
years ago with the Amish Friendship Starter.  It worked great so I'm happy
to pass the idea along.
